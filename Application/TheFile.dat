Photograph: Michael Dalder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2>1. Robin van Persie’s headed goal against Spain in Salvador</h2> <p>In my book it was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/16/world-cup-2014-robin-van-persie-flipbook\" title=\"\">best goal of the World Cup</a>, though I recognise there was strong competition from James Rodríguez and Tim Cahill, but in terms of being memorable it is already becoming part of indelible tournament folklore, to be replayed for as long as World Cups last. Not only was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/14/holland-spain-world-cup-robin-van-persie-arjen-robben-louis-van-gaal\" title=\"\">the goal improbable</a>, in that it came from nowhere and demanded incredible co-ordination and execution from the scorer, it was significant. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/spain-holland-world-cup-2014-group-b-match-report\" title=\"\">It put the skids under Spain</a> for the first time in four tournaments. As with Van Persie’s Superman act, no one saw that coming.</p> <h2>2. Gareth Bale’s sprint out of play and back to score the winning goal in the Copa del Rey against Barcelona</h2> <p>More bad news for tiki-taka. Spectacle, speed and strength are still enduring qualities in football, and when they combine to produce a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/16/barcelona-real-madrid-copa-del-rey-match-report-gareth-bale\" title=\"\">stunning winner five minutes from the end of a cup final</a> the result is irresistible, as was the commentary from Real’s in house television crew. Xabi Alonso confessed he had never seen a goal quite like it, and it is doubtful anyone else in the Mestalla had either.</p> <p>Bale scored a goal in the Champions League final too, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">helping secure <em>la décima</em></a> and complete a memorable season for Madrid, but his Copa del Rey effort captured the imagination most.</p> <h2>3. Brazil 1-7 Germany</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2fbba33a-c05b-49eb-becb-fd5bf00e061c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418825752176/44838110-b28f-448b-9cbe-04d854cc09ad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"emotional Brazil fan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An emotional Brazil fan reacts after being defeated by Germany 7-1 during the semi-final in Belo Horizonte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the sense of remembering exactly where you were when this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/08/germany-brazil-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">car-crash of a World Cup semi-final</a> took place, Germany’s unforgettable demolition of the hosts may be the most memorable football moment of the century, never mind just 2014. It was not a complete surprise, as anyone who had been paying attention to events in Brazil would have known that Germany were running hot while the home team were struggling to live up to expectations, but since when have World Cup semis turned into routs? When was the last time Brazil took such a World Cup battering? (Don’t bother checking, they never have before.) “We froze for six minutes,” Manchester City’s Fernandinho admitted. “That killed the game for us, but we will probably be answering questions about it for the rest of our lives.”</p> <h2>4 England 0-3 Germany</h2> <p>Yes, another German rout, this time in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/23/england-women-germany-international-friendly-match-report\" title=\"\">women’s international at Wembley in November</a>, but at least this time the home side did not fall apart and concede a record score. Thanks in part to an early own goal Germany were two up after 12 minutes and had assumed an unassailable 3-0 lead by the interval, yet the game was never as one-sided as the men’s World Cup semi. The major talking point in any case was the crowd. Over 45,000 people turned up at Wembley to watch, and more might have come along had not a cap been put on ticket sales to prevent London’s transport system overheating. England Women have not beaten Germany in 20 attempts but as next year’s World Cup approaches there is no shortage of interest in their progress.</p> <h2>5. David Moyes and the Grim Reaper at Goodison Park</h2> <p>Not a particularly smart or tasteful stunt, but a reminder of what managers have to put up with these days, and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/21/david-moyes-sack-manchester-united\" title=\"\"> a slick, if sick, image</a> to conjure the living hell of Moyes’s final few games at Manchester United. To say Sir Alex Ferguson’s plans for the succession did not work out might be the understatement of 2014, although the botch began in the summer of the previous year when Moyes was made an offer he did not feel he could turn down. His task proved an impossible one and support almost visibly slipped away. Now United have a new manager, the sort of supercoach Ferguson originally tried to resist, and Moyes is having to remake his reputation abroad. With hindsight, what Ferguson should have realised is how much the club had grown since his own appointment in 1986. Sticking to the same recruitment template was never going to work.</p> <h2>6. Luis Suárez bites Giorgio Chiellini in Natal</h2> <p>The Uruguayan striker is no stranger to World Cup controversy – he handled on the line against Ghana in 2010 and joked about his goalkeeping ability once his side had survived his dismissal to progress at the Africans’ expense – but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/26/world-cup-luis-suarez-ban-biting-uruguay\" title=\"\">another bite on the biggest stage</a> was the last thing anyone expected in Brazil. Once it happened it became clear that Suárez was out of control, unable to help himself and in need of a swift move to La Liga to prevent the English media making his persecution complex any worse. He got his way and since he has yet to seriously hurt an opponent with his teeth, let alone kill anyone, he probably deserves the benefit of the doubt. But still, not the sort of thing one can easily forget or forgive.</p> <h2>7. Crystal Palace 3-3 Liverpool</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Steven Gerrard’s slip against Chelsea</a> is what everyone is still singing about, the symbolic moment when Liverpool’s unlikely challenge slipped away, yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/05/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the next game at Selhurst Park</a> was even more dramatic and has the advantage, from the point of view of a review such as this, of killing two birds with one stone. Liverpool’s title bid was not the only story of the second half of last season, Palace’s incredible revival under Tony Pulis was another, which was why the Welshman rivalled Brendan Rodgers for manager of the year. Three goals up at one point, Liverpool conceded three late in the game, partly through trying to score more to boost their goal difference. At the end a distraught Suárez was too embarrassed to show his face, yet without his goals, as this season is proving, Liverpool would have been nowhere near the top.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/25/manchester-city-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sergio Agüero’s hat-trick against Bayern Munich</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f1b53be4-d3a4-44ca-8ff1-9316ffaae774\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418825919858/f3fab087-b34a-4aa6-8921-1ae740b9ecf9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sergio Aguero celebrates.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sergio Aguero celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Manchester City’s cause looked lost in their penultimate Champions League group game in November, even after having a man sent off the Germans had come back from a goal down to take control and lead 2-1. There seemed no point in even hoping, but Agüero is the sort of clinical finisher who thrives in those situations and given a chance almost always has the composure to score. His first goal in the game was a penalty, but he would most likely have scored had he not been illegally brought down. His second took advantage of a rare misplaced pass by Alonso, though he still had Manuel Neuer to beat, and by the time his third chance arrived in the closing seconds the entire stadium would have put money on him taking it. City have been hard work in Europe this season but they have had their moments of magic too.</p> <h2>9. MK Dons 4-0 Manchester United</h2> <p>You can’t beat a good giant-killing and, with respect to Wigan Athletic’s removal of Manchester City from the FA Cup for the second season running, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/26/mk-dons-manchester-united-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">here was one the whole country enjoyed</a>.</p> <p>Everyone likes to see expensive players given the runaround by enthusiastic journeymen and the expression on Luis van Gaal’s face alone was worth cutting out to keep. There is one photograph, in fact, where Van Gaal is fronting up for the cameras, looking straight ahead without displaying any emotion, while next to him on the bench Ryan Giggs is hiding his face in his hands. “I am not shocked, I know what happens in football,” the new United manager said after a comprehensive defeat to a side that cost £500,000 to assemble. “A new team is not built in one month.”</p> <h2>10.

Robin van Persie’s headed goal against Spain in Salvador In my book it was the best goal of the World Cup, though I recognise there was strong competition from James Rodríguez and Tim Cahill, but in terms of being memorable it is already becoming part of indelible tournament folklore, to be replayed for as long as World Cups last. Not only was the goal improbable, in that it came from nowhere and demanded incredible co-ordination and execution from the scorer, it was significant. It put the skids under Spain for the first time in four tournaments. As with Van Persie’s Superman act, no one saw that coming. 2. Gareth Bale’s sprint out of play and back to score the winning goal in the Copa del Rey against Barcelona More bad news for tiki-taka. Spectacle, speed and strength are still enduring qualities in football, and when they combine to produce a stunning winner five minutes from the end of a cup final the result is irresistible, as was the commentary from Real’s in house television crew. Xabi Alonso confessed he had never seen a goal quite like it, and it is doubtful anyone else in the Mestalla had either. Bale scored a goal in the Champions League final too, helping secure la décima and complete a memorable season for Madrid, but his Copa del Rey effort captured the imagination most. 3. Brazil 1-7 Germany In the sense of remembering exactly where you were when this car-crash of a World Cup semi-final took place, Germany’s unforgettable demolition of the hosts may be the most memorable football moment of the century, never mind just 2014. It was not a complete surprise, as anyone who had been paying attention to events in Brazil would have known that Germany were running hot while the home team were struggling to live up to expectations, but since when have World Cup semis turned into routs? When was the last time Brazil took such a World Cup battering? (Don’t bother checking, they never have before.) “We froze for six minutes,” Manchester City’s Fernandinho admitted. “That killed the game for us, but we will probably be answering questions about it for the rest of our lives.” 4 England 0-3 Germany Yes, another German rout, this time in a women’s international at Wembley in November, but at least this time the home side did not fall apart and concede a record score. Thanks in part to an early own goal Germany were two up after 12 minutes and had assumed an unassailable 3-0 lead by the interval, yet the game was never as one-sided as the men’s World Cup semi. The major talking point in any case was the crowd. Over 45,000 people turned up at Wembley to watch, and more might have come along had not a cap been put on ticket sales to prevent London’s transport system overheating. England Women have not beaten Germany in 20 attempts but as next year’s World Cup approaches there is no shortage of interest in their progress. 5. David Moyes and the Grim Reaper at Goodison Park Not a particularly smart or tasteful stunt, but a reminder of what managers have to put up with these days, and a slick, if sick, image to conjure the living hell of Moyes’s final few games at Manchester United. To say Sir Alex Ferguson’s plans for the succession did not work out might be the understatement of 2014, although the botch began in the summer of the previous year when Moyes was made an offer he did not feel he could turn down. His task proved an impossible one and support almost visibly slipped away. Now United have a new manager, the sort of supercoach Ferguson originally tried to resist, and Moyes is having to remake his reputation abroad. With hindsight, what Ferguson should have realised is how much the club had grown since his own appointment in 1986. Sticking to the same recruitment template was never going to work. 6. Luis Suárez bites Giorgio Chiellini in Natal The Uruguayan striker is no stranger to World Cup controversy – he handled on the line against Ghana in 2010 and joked about his goalkeeping ability once his side had survived his dismissal to progress at the Africans’ expense – but another bite on the biggest stage was the last thing anyone expected in Brazil. Once it happened it became clear that Suárez was out of control, unable to help himself and in need of a swift move to La Liga to prevent the English media making his persecution complex any worse. He got his way and since he has yet to seriously hurt an opponent with his teeth, let alone kill anyone, he probably deserves the benefit of the doubt. But still, not the sort of thing one can easily forget or forgive. 7. Crystal Palace 3-3 Liverpool Steven Gerrard’s slip against Chelsea is what everyone is still singing about, the symbolic moment when Liverpool’s unlikely challenge slipped away, yet the next game at Selhurst Park was even more dramatic and has the advantage, from the point of view of a review such as this, of killing two birds with one stone. Liverpool’s title bid was not the only story of the second half of last season, Palace’s incredible revival under Tony Pulis was another, which was why the Welshman rivalled Brendan Rodgers for manager of the year. Three goals up at one point, Liverpool conceded three late in the game, partly through trying to score more to boost their goal difference. At the end a distraught Suárez was too embarrassed to show his face, yet without his goals, as this season is proving, Liverpool would have been nowhere near the top. 8. Sergio Agüero’s hat-trick against Bayern Munich Manchester City’s cause looked lost in their penultimate Champions League group game in November, even after having a man sent off the Germans had come back from a goal down to take control and lead 2-1. There seemed no point in even hoping, but Agüero is the sort of clinical finisher who thrives in those situations and given a chance almost always has the composure to score. His first goal in the game was a penalty, but he would most likely have scored had he not been illegally brought down. His second took advantage of a rare misplaced pass by Alonso, though he still had Manuel Neuer to beat, and by the time his third chance arrived in the closing seconds the entire stadium would have put money on him taking it. City have been hard work in Europe this season but they have had their moments of magic too. 9. MK Dons 4-0 Manchester United You can’t beat a good giant-killing and, with respect to Wigan Athletic’s removal of Manchester City from the FA Cup for the second season running, here was one the whole country enjoyed. Everyone likes to see expensive players given the runaround by enthusiastic journeymen and the expression on Luis van Gaal’s face alone was worth cutting out to keep. There is one photograph, in fact, where Van Gaal is fronting up for the cameras, looking straight ahead without displaying any emotion, while next to him on the bench Ryan Giggs is hiding his face in his hands. “I am not shocked, I know what happens in football,” the new United manager said after a comprehensive defeat to a side that cost £500,000 to assemble. “A new team is not built in one month.” 10. Chile fans break into Maracanã stadium via media centre This is not a personal memory, I was not at the Chile v Spain game, but alarm bells ought to be ringing when ordinary fans feel priced out of a World Cup in Brazil. Geographical proximity allowed Chile supporters to travel to Rio in numbers, only to be dismayed at the price and limited availability of tickets to see their team. Perhaps that was naive, but football, even at a World Cup, should be more accessible. This was the most high-profile protest, even if it was poorly planned and not particularly successful, and it chimed with black flags on the Kop and similar grumbles about high prices and absurd scheduling in this country. Friday night football, anyone? 2014 was not just about Fifa scandals, though heaven knows there were enough of those, it was another bad year for football as the people’s game.","charCount":"7952"},"references":[{"id":"opta-football-tournament/4/2014","type":"opta-football-tournament"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/11","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/43","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/22","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/12","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/5","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/628","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/26303","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/398","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/186","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/614","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/198","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-competition/700","type":"pa-football-competition"},{"id":"pa-football-team/2559","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/20","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/12","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/22","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/1","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/13","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/550","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/23104","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/11","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/14","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/9","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/31","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"esa-football-team//football/team/3","type":"esa-football-team"},{"id":"pa-football-team/26247","type":"pa-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/831","type":"opta-football-team"},{"id":"opta-football-team/156","type":"opta-football-team"}],"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/17/data-revolution-limitations-in-images","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T14:08:27Z","webTitle":"The problem with the data revolution in four Venn diagrams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/17/data-revolution-limitations-in-images","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/17/data-revolution-limitations-in-images","fields":{"headline":"The problem with the data revolution in four Venn diagrams","standfirst":"<p>With its poor understanding of data, the recent report from Ban Ki Moon’s independent advisory group is not a practical roadmap</p>","trailText":"With its poor understanding of data, the recent report from Ban Ki Moon’s independent advisory group is not a practical roadmap, argues <strong>Morten Jerven</strong>","byline":"Morten Jerven","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3802c209e647a115428726fad60d14253b21c367\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418734440006/f630e805-c7e6-4830-bd07-4bc462d4f828-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"networked people\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The limits of the data revolution: not everything that counts can be counted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>In August, UN secretary-general Ban Ki Moon named his independent expert advisory group, 24 experts tasked with providing recommendations on how best to use data to deliver the sustainable development goals. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=48594#.VJBBI2SsXGJ\">press release at the time, Ban said</a>: “The data revolution is giving the world powerful tools that can help usher in a more sustainable future.

John Vine, the chief inspector of borders and immigration, revealed the existence of a further 223,600 records of foreign nationals who have overstayed their visas, all dated before December 2008, in a report published on Wednesday. The report said that, despite considerable efforts by the Home Office and its contractor Capita, the size of the post-2008 backlog of cases of overstayers against whom no action has been taken had remained almost static at 173,562. Vine added that, of the 120,000 cases sent to Capita for them to contact, fewer than 1% had left the country as a result of their intervention. Wednesday’s figures follow the release last week of Vine’s report on citizenship, which showed that even killers had been given British passports because of lax Home Office character checks. Vine is leaving the chief inspector’s job at the end of this year, seven months early, after a row with Theresa May, the home secretary, over delays in her decisions to publish his reports. He has secured assurance from her that in future she will aim to publish them within eight weeks.

At least, we know enough that we can make the call. According the <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php\">global data from NOAA</a>, 2014 will be the hottest year ever recorded. <br></p> <p>I can make this pronouncement even before the end of the year because each month, I collect daily global average temperatures. So far, December is running about 0.5°C above the average. The climate and weather models predict that the next week will be about 0.75°C above average. This means, December will come in around 0.6°C above average. Are these daily values accurate? Well the last two months they have been within 0.05°C of the final official results. <br></p> <p>What does this all mean? Well, when I combine December with the year-to-date as officially reported, I predict the annual temperature anomaly will be 0.674°C. This beats the prior record by 0.024°C. That is a big margin in terms of global temperatures.</p> <p>For those of us who are not fixated on whether any individual year is a record but are more concerned with trends, this year is still important. Particularly because according to those who deny the basic physics and our understanding of climate change, this year wasn’t supposed to be particularly warm. <br></p> <p>For those who thought that climate change was “natural” and driven by ocean currents, this has been a tough year. For instance, using NOAA standards, this year didn’t even have an El Niño. NOAA defines an El Niño as 5 continuous/overlapping 3-month time periods wherein a particular region in the Pacific has temperatures elevated more than 0.5<sup>o</sup>C. <br></p> <p>Interestingly, we are currently close to an El Niño, and if current patterns continue for a few weeks, an official El Niño will be announced. But it hasn’t been yet, and if we do get an El Niño, it will affect next year more than this year. How could the hottest year have occurred then, when the cards are not stacked in its favor?

At least, we know enough that we can make the call. According the global data from NOAA, 2014 will be the hottest year ever recorded. I can make this pronouncement even before the end of the year because each month, I collect daily global average temperatures. So far, December is running about 0.5°C above the average. The climate and weather models predict that the next week will be about 0.75°C above average. This means, December will come in around 0.6°C above average. Are these daily values accurate? Well the last two months they have been within 0.05°C of the final official results. What does this all mean? Well, when I combine December with the year-to-date as officially reported, I predict the annual temperature anomaly will be 0.674°C. This beats the prior record by 0.024°C. That is a big margin in terms of global temperatures. For those of us who are not fixated on whether any individual year is a record but are more concerned with trends, this year is still important. Particularly because according to those who deny the basic physics and our understanding of climate change, this year wasn’t supposed to be particularly warm. For those who thought that climate change was “natural” and driven by ocean currents, this has been a tough year. For instance, using NOAA standards, this year didn’t even have an El Niño. NOAA defines an El Niño as 5 continuous/overlapping 3-month time periods wherein a particular region in the Pacific has temperatures elevated more than 0.5oC. Interestingly, we are currently close to an El Niño, and if current patterns continue for a few weeks, an official El Niño will be announced. But it hasn’t been yet, and if we do get an El Niño, it will affect next year more than this year. How could the hottest year have occurred then, when the cards are not stacked in its favor? The obvious and correct answer is, because of continued emission of greenhouse gases.

The TTP—or factions thereof—are defined as bad because it targets the Pakistani state. Those who hold similar ideologies but operate outside Pakistan, in Afghanistan and India, or even target Shias within Pakistan are tolerated.</p> <p>This partly reflects a hangover from the past, when Islamist groups in Kashmir and the Afghan Taliban were seen as useful instruments for Pakistan’s foreign policy; the use of proxy forces by Pakistan goes back to its independence in 1947. It also reflects the weakness of civilian governments; many radical groups also undertake popular social functions such as health care, education and flood relief, which help to cover up the poor capabilities of the Pakistani state. In addition, there is a logic in Pakistan politicians’ preferring that violence be displaced from Pakistan into Afghanistan, the path recently taken by the “Punjabi Taliban” in September this year. </p> <p>Pakistan’s ambivalence toward the Afghan Taliban has also stemmed from a lack of belief in the solidity of the Afghan state.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-549174ebe4b022bc30045317\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T12:27:44.903Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Imran and Sharif in 'dialogue'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Images of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif next to opposition leader Imran Khan at the all-party meeting in Peshawar have been broadcast on Pakistani TV. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MalihaMansoori/statuses/545190286398210049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>A Sight We Have Wished To See Since Past Four Months.&#10;I Appreciate Both.&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeshawarAttack?src=hash\">#PeshawarAttack</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnitedAgainstTTP?src=hash\">#UnitedAgainstTTP</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/05c5wiNUaP\">pic.twitter.com/05c5wiNUaP</a></p>&mdash; Maliha Mansoori (@MalihaMansoori) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalihaMansoori/status/545190286398210049\">December 17, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Nawaz announced that <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/808157/live-nation-mourns-141-lives-lost-in-peshawar-school-attack/\">“dialogue can resolve all sorts of issues,”</a> after inviting Imran for tea, the Express Tribune reported. </p> <p>Imran interupted to say: “Our differences are not about our egos, it is about rigging.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54916eeee4b017bd53de1c03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T12:16:26.264Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s a summary of the latest developments:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/dec/17/pakistan-school-attack-reprisals-against-taliban-after-132-children-killed-in-peshawar-rolling-report?CMP=share_btn_tw#block-54912ca4e4b07a51e943a10b\"><strong>The first funerals of the 141 victims of an attack on a military school in Peshawar have taken place as Pakistan began three days of national mourning. </strong></a>More details have emerged about those killed including the school’s principal Tahira Qazi.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/dec/17/pakistan-school-attack-reprisals-against-taliban-after-132-children-killed-in-peshawar-rolling-report?CMP=share_btn_tw#block-5491340ae4b07a51e943a110\"><strong>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has reintroduced the death penalty for terrorism related cases, following what was Pakistan’s worst terrorist incident.</strong></a> He announced that he was lifting a moratorium on capital punishment at an emergency all-party meeting in Peshawar. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/dec/17/pakistan-school-attack-reprisals-against-taliban-after-132-children-killed-in-peshawar-rolling-report?CMP=share_btn_tw#block-54912ca4e4b07a51e943a10b\"><strong><br></strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/dec/17/pakistan-school-attack-reprisals-against-taliban-after-132-children-killed-in-peshawar-rolling-report?CMP=share_btn_tw#block-54916871e4b0f05d5cd391c4\"><strong>Pakistan’s army chief General Raheel Sharif has travelled to Kabul for talks on how to tackle the Taliban with Afghan president Ashraf Ghani. </strong></a>ISAF commander General John Campbell is also due to take part in the meeting. </li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/dec/17/pakistan-school-attack-reprisals-against-taliban-after-132-children-killed-in-peshawar-rolling-report?CMP=share_btn_tw#block-54916cf6e4b017bd53de1c02\"><strong>A suspected Taliban attack on a bank in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, killed at least 10 people. </strong></a>The Taliban in Afghanistan condemned the attack on Peshawar underlining divisions in the movement. <br></li> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/dec/16/over-100-people-killed-in-pakistan-taliban-school-siege-says-provincial-chief-minister-live-updates#block-54904013e4b07a51e943a00a\">Pakistani forces have launched at least 10 air strikes on the Taliban in the wake of the school attack</a></strong>.

And earlier this month Afghan and US troops did exactly that: In one drone, attack nine members of the TTP were killed in Kunar province.</p> <p>In another sign of changing attitudes, in late November Pakistan took credit for targeting members of the Haqqani Network, a group linked to the Afghan Taliban. While the extent of its attack on the group cannot be verified, in the past the Haqqani Network appeared to have been spared the treatment meted out to the TTP and remained, in the words of U.S. Admiral Mike Mullen, “a veritable arm of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency.” </p> <p>The attack in Peshawar is tragic and unlikely to be the last. But the region stands on the cusp of a potentially game-changing transformation in which the Afghan and Pakistan governments understand that their interests are best served working together rather than undermining each other.</p> <p>That the TTP felt the need to launch its most deadly attack at this juncture is likely to reflect its concern about what this could mean.</p> </blockquote> </div>

It will need responsible governance and an acknowledgment by top leaders that they cannot contain attacks from one terrorist group while enabling another one.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T06:47:15.387Z\">at 6.47am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-549123c1e4b0295e49f72440\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T06:34:28.060Z\">6.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lots of funerals are being held across Peshawar today.

Historically, the frontier city has been a key transport route, the terminus of the Grand Trunk Road of India and a major depot for trade with Afghanistan.</p> <p>While it is only a little more than a two-hour drive from Islamabad, Peshawar is a very different city to the middle-class capital. On the edge of Pakistan’s “tribal belt”, Peshawar is poorer, jobs are hard to find and sectarian violence has steadily increased over recent years. Many Afghan refugees, displaced by decades of violence in their homeland, live in slums and camps in and around the city. This year, the World Health Organisation declared Peshawar the world’s “largest reservoir” of endemic polio. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T05:14:11.384Z\">at 5.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54910a61e4b07a51e943a0f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T04:48:33.188Z\">4.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The day after...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is morning now in Pakistan, and soldiers are back on the grounds of the Army Public School in Peshawar, where 141 people, including 132 children, were murdered by the Pakistani Taliban.

its strongholds</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Pakistani Taliban says its attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar was retaliation for the military’s ongoing operation against its strongholds in the borderlands of North Waziristan. It wanted to kill the children of soldiers.</p> <p>“We selected the army’s school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females,” Taliban spokesman Muhammad Umar Khorasani said. “We want them to feel the pain.”</p> <p>In June, the Pakistani army launched “Zarb-e-Azb”, a “comprehensive operation against foreign and local terrorists who are hiding in sanctuaries in North Waziristan”.</p> <p>The “foreign” reference is to Afghan fighters. The lawless, mountainous regions of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are used as planning and staging areas for Taliban attacks across the two countries. After years of promising to drive militants from their hideaways, the Pakistani government has committed up to 30,000 troops to the operation. Pakistan believes it needs to secure the region before the end of Nato combat operations this year in Afghanistan. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T05:23:09.435Z\">at 5.23am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5490f554e4b0dc2dc14959b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T03:15:41.241Z\">3.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edff90a47d5eae68132442b2abf82eca49ad34e1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418786128355/f072563b-1076-40b3-871f-464cab229b2c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A school boy injured during the attack by Taliban gunmen at Army Public School in Peshawar.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A schoolboy injured during the attack by Taliban gunmen at Army Public School in Peshawar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bilawal Arbab/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T03:19:46.550Z\">at 3.19am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5490f400e4b07a51e943a0e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T03:14:07.320Z\">3.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">800 attacks on schools in three years</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Pakistan this morning, people are asking why was this attack allowed to happen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/authors/410/dawnrafiazakaria\">Rafia Zakaria</a> from <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/\">Dawn</a> filed this excellent report on Pakistan’s <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/authors/410/dawnrafiazakaria\">schools of sorrow</a>.</p> <p>Zakaria writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Outrage is an easy emotion in Pakistan and after a decade of terrorist attacks almost a habit; when the tears dry up as tears do, little changes.</p> <p>Were we not locked into this cycle of act, outrage and forgetfulness, the imminence of an attack such as this one would have long been acknowledged, its probability seen as high, its likelihood necessitating preparation and security.</p> <p>There were numbers that told of the possibility; a report issued by the Global Coalition for the Protection of Education earlier this year noted that in the years between 2009 and 2012 there were <a href=\"http://www.protectingeducation.org/country-profile/pakistan\">800 attacks on schools in Pakistan</a>.</p> <p>Not one or two, but 800 warnings of the carnage to come, boxed away, set aside, pushed away to the back pages of newspapers, the recesses of consciousness.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5490ee05e4b0dc2dc14959b7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-17T03:02:12.798Z\">3.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Witness accounts are emerging from students who survived:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Shahrukh Khan</strong>, 16, was shot in both legs.

Here’s a summary of the latest developments: The first funerals of the 148 victims of an attack on a military school in Peshawar have taken place as Pakistan began three days of national mourning. More details have emerged about those killed including the school’s principal Tahira Qazi. Pakistan’s rival political leaders have agreed to come up with a plan to combat terrorism within a week. Announcing the move after all party meeting in Peshawar Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said there would be no more distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ Taliban groups. Sharif has reintroduced the death penalty for terrorism related cases, following what was Pakistan’s worst terrorist incident. He announced that he was lifting a moratorium on capital punishment. Pakistan’s army chief General Raheel Sharif has travelled to Kabul for talks on how to tackle the Taliban with Afghan president Ashraf Ghani. “Vital intelligence” was shared at the meeting, according to a military spokesman. A suspected Taliban attack on a bank in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, killed at least 10 people. The Taliban in Afghanistan condemned the attack on Peshawar underlining divisions in the movement. Pakistani forces have launched at least 10 air strikes on the Taliban in the wake of the school attack. Prime minister Sharif vowed that the Zarb-e-Azb offensive against the Taliban in Pakistan would continue. The Pakistani authorities have stated that the death toll from the attack now stands at 148 people. The number of students killed remains at 132. Another 121 students and three staff members were wounded in the assault. Lanterns have been lit for all 148 victims at a vigil in Karachi. Pakistan has shared “vital intelligence” with Afghanistan during the visit of army chief General Raheel Sharif to Kabul, according to military spokesman Asim Bajwal. A retired Afghan general claim edthe trip is a sham, according to AFP. General Atiqullah Amarkhail dismissed the trip as an attempt to distract attention from the failure to prevent the attack in the northwestern city of Peshawar. “The trip is no more than a manoeuvre by the Pakistanis to pressure the Afghan government and pretend those responsible for the deadly Peshawar attack are based in Afghan soil,” said Amarkhail. Pakistan political rivals have agreed to come up with a national plan on tackling terrorism, in the wake of the Peshawar attack, Radio Pakistan reports. The leaders decided to form a Committee under the chairmanship of Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan to prepare a National Plan of Action against terrorism within a week. The Committee will have one representative each from parliamentary and other political parties. Representatives of the Armed Forces and intelligence agencies will also be part of the Committee. The National Plan of Action would be presented before the national political leadership in seven days for approval. It will then be placed before the nation by national political and military leadership.. The resolution announced that there will be no discrimination between good and bad Talibans and the war against terror will continue with the national spirit. The Pakistani Taliban has posted photographs of six Islamic fighters they said took part in the Peshawar assault, AP confirms. In one photo, the militants are seen wearing army fatigues, standing with a local Taliban leader in what the statement claimed one of the Pakistani tribal regions. The Independent has more... At his press conference in Peshawar, the prime minister announced there will no more distinction etween “good” and “bad” Taliban. “We have resolved to continue the war against terrorism till the last terrorist is eliminated,” he said according to the Express Tribune. Chatham House’s Gareth Price has background on the distinction: The longer-standing complaint against Pakistan is that it picks and chooses between “good” and “bad” Taliban. The TTP—or factions thereof—are defined as bad because it targets the Pakistani state. Those who hold similar ideologies but operate outside Pakistan, in Afghanistan and India, or even target Shias within Pakistan are tolerated. This partly reflects a hangover from the past, when Islamist groups in Kashmir and the Afghan Taliban were seen as useful instruments for Pakistan’s foreign policy; the use of proxy forces by Pakistan goes back to its independence in 1947. It also reflects the weakness of civilian governments; many radical groups also undertake popular social functions such as health care, education and flood relief, which help to cover up the poor capabilities of the Pakistani state. In addition, there is a logic in Pakistan politicians’ preferring that violence be displaced from Pakistan into Afghanistan, the path recently taken by the “Punjabi Taliban” in September this year. Pakistan’s ambivalence toward the Afghan Taliban has also stemmed from a lack of belief in the solidity of the Afghan state. Images of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif next to opposition leader Imran Khan at the all-party meeting in Peshawar have been broadcast on Pakistani TV. Nawaz announced that “dialogue can resolve all sorts of issues,” after inviting Imran for tea, the Express Tribune reported. Imran interupted to say: “Our differences are not about our egos, it is about rigging.” Here’s a summary of the latest developments: The first funerals of the 141 victims of an attack on a military school in Peshawar have taken place as Pakistan began three days of national mourning. More details have emerged about those killed including the school’s principal Tahira Qazi. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has reintroduced the death penalty for terrorism related cases, following what was Pakistan’s worst terrorist incident. He announced that he was lifting a moratorium on capital punishment at an emergency all-party meeting in Peshawar. Pakistan’s army chief General Raheel Sharif has travelled to Kabul for talks on how to tackle the Taliban with Afghan president Ashraf Ghani. ISAF commander General John Campbell is also due to take part in the meeting. A suspected Taliban attack on a bank in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, killed at least 10 people. The Taliban in Afghanistan condemned the attack on Peshawar underlining divisions in the movement. Pakistani forces have launched at least 10 air strikes on the Taliban in the wake of the school attack. Prime minister Sharif vowed that the Zarb-e-Azb offensive against the Taliban in Pakistan would continue. A suspected Taliban attack on a bank in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, killed at least 10 people, AP reports citing policemen and officials. In the attack, in the provincial capital, Lashgar Gah, five suicide bombers raided the city’s branch of the New Kabul Bank. One of the attackers blew himself up at the front entrance to allow the other three in, said Omer Zawaj, the spokesman for the provincial governor. Once inside, the other attackers fired at security forces, which arrived at the scene and surrounded the building, Zawaj said. Helmand police spokesman, Fareed Obaid, said three police officers were among those killed. “There are also 15 people wounded, including six members of the Afghan security forces,” he said, adding that the rest of the insurgents were killed in the gunbattle. Afghanistan’s war with the insurgents, whose leadership is based in Pakistan, has escalated in recent months, and angered President Ashraf Ghani who has vowed to bring peace to the country. The election of Ghani as president has led Afghanistan to shift course on the Taliban, according to Gareth Price senior research fellow at the foreign affairs thinktank Chatham House. In an article for Newsweek he writes: While his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, was quick to blame Pakistan for incidents in Afghanistan, Ghani has taken the view that stability in Afghanistan requires cooperation rather than confrontation with Pakistan, and he recently accepted Pakistan’s long-standing offer to help train Afghanistan’s military. But for Pakistan, meaningful cooperation would require Afghanistan to take action against Pakistan Taliban groups in Afghanistan. And earlier this month Afghan and US troops did exactly that: In one drone, attack nine members of the TTP were killed in Kunar province. In another sign of changing attitudes, in late November Pakistan took credit for targeting members of the Haqqani Network, a group linked to the Afghan Taliban. While the extent of its attack on the group cannot be verified, in the past the Haqqani Network appeared to have been spared the treatment meted out to the TTP and remained, in the words of U.S. Admiral Mike Mullen, “a veritable arm of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency.” The attack in Peshawar is tragic and unlikely to be the last. But the region stands on the cusp of a potentially game-changing transformation in which the Afghan and Pakistan governments understand that their interests are best served working together rather than undermining each other. That the TTP felt the need to launch its most deadly attack at this juncture is likely to reflect its concern about what this could mean. AFP has more on the visit by Pakistan’s military command to Kabul. Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Raheel Sharif who was accompanied by the head of the Pakistan’s main intelligence agency, the ISI, is set to meet Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and ISAF commander General John Campbell, according to a brief statement by the military. Some of the militants who attacked the army-run school in Peshawar Tuesday spoke in Arabic, a senior security official told AFP, which he said suggested that they had links over the border in Afghanistan. “The army chief is likely to take Afghan leadership on board on this issue,” the security official said, adding that the handing over of Pakistani Taliban chief Mullah Fazlullah, who is believed to be hiding in northeastern Afghanistan, may also figure at the talks in Kabul. Afghanistan routinely accuses Pakistan of providing shelter within its borders to the Afghan Taliban, while Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of protecting members of the Pakistani Taliban. Analysts said the visit was intended to further cooperation against militants group along the countries’ shared border. “The army chief is obviously interested that Tehrik-e-Taliban chief Maulana Fazlullah and his group is arrested and handed over to Pakistan or eliminated so that they do not use Afghan territory for launching attacks against Pakistan as happened in Peshawar on Tuesday,” retired general and security analyst Talat Masood told AFP. “General Sharif wants to strengthen military-to-military and intelligence-to-intelligence level cooperation between the two countries otherwise sanctuaries in Afghanistan will be used against Pakistan,” he added. Pakistan’s powerful army and intelligence services are widely seen as being the driving force behind the country’s defence and foreign policies. The Pakistan Cricket Board has called off a cup final match in Muridke as a mark of respect, but a limited overs international between Pakistan and New Zealand in Abu Dhabi is due to go ahead despite calls for it to be postponed. There are plans to hold a two-minute silence at the match, and the proceeds will be donated to families of the victims. More grim images from inside the school have emerged, showing classrooms riddled with bullets and carpets soaked in blood. Prime minister Nawas Sharif has vowed to push ahead with an army offensive against the Taliban in Pakitan or Tehrik-e-Taliban. The group claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday, claiming it was revenge for an offensive launched against it in the summer named Zarb-e-Azb. Speaking at an all party meeting in Peshawar today Sharif said Zarb-e-Azb “is successfully moving forward and Pakistan was making efforts for peace in the region”, according to the Pakistan Radio. It added: The prime minister stressed that the nation is waging jihad against terrorism and this mission will not be left unaccomplished. He recalled that the government started dialogue with militants after evolving consensus of all political parties. But the government was left with no other option but to launch military operation against terrorists due to their intransigence. Overnight, the body of the school principal, Tahira Qazi, was found among the debris, AP reports. Qazi was inside her office when the militants made their way into the administration building 20 meters from the auditorium. She had ran and locked herself into the bathroom but the attackers threw a grenade inside, through a vent, and killed her, according to army spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa. There have been widespread tributes to Qazi. Images of some of the victims of the attack have been published, notes Omar Quraishi, an editor at the Express Tribune. The Pakistan Taliban has identified the militants who carried out the attack on the school, according to reporter Harald Doornbos. AFP has a grim graphic on the deadliest militant attacks in Pakistan since 2007. Tuesday’s school massacre, which killed 132 children and nine members of staff, was the worst. Pakistan’s army commander General Raheel Sharif is heading to Kabul. The trip is designed as public show of putting pressure on Afghanistan to do something about the TTP leadership hiding in Kunar and Nuristan provinces in the east of the country, according to the Guardian’s Jon Boone. Sharif will be accompanied by other top brass in the Pakistani military, according to the Express Tribune. The delegation is due to hold talks with Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, according to a military spokesman Asim Bajwal. Before Tuesday’s attack the level of disapproval for the Taliban in Pakistan [TTP] was falling among Pakistanis, while a some even expressed support, writes Shashank Joshi an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. In an article for the Interpreter he highlights Pew research conducted in August. At the time of the survey, 8% of surveyed Pakistanis held a favourable view of the TTP. This is a small proportion, and belies the notion of widespread popularity. Nonetheless, on a crude extrapolation, it would amount to a staggering 14 million Pakistanis. Although a much larger slice of the population holds negative views of the Taliban (59%), this disapproval rate has fallen steadily from a high of 70% in 2009, a year when the Pakistani army was engaged in intense fighting with the militants in the Swat Valley. Depressingly, it is the lowest level of disapproval in six years. For all the horror of Tuesday’s events it is still unclear whether disapproval will now start to increase, Joshi says: The question is whether the imagery and testimony from Tuesday – a teacher burnt alive in front of students, reported beheadings, and the Taliban’s promise that this is ‘just the trailer’ – will serve as a catalysing moment, reversing the trend in attitudes of the past few years, or whether it will go down in history as just one more vicious attack marking a downward spiral of violence. Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Malala the Nobel peace prize winning school girl who was shot by the Taliban in 2012, has spoken on his family’s “trauma” over the school attack. “My wife went unconscious,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. AFP has more on the decision to lift the moratorium on the death penalty for terrorism. “The prime minister has approved abolishment of moratorium on the execution of death penalty in terrorism-related cases,” an official from Sharif’s office said. Hanging remains on the Pakistani statute book and judges continue to pass the death sentence, but a de facto moratorium on civilian executions has been in place since 2008. Only one person has been executed since then, a soldier convicted by a court martial and hanged in November 2012. Rights campaign group Amnesty International estimates that Pakistan has more than 8,000 prisoners on death row, most of whom have exhausted the appeals process. The prime minister has been chairing an all party on the response to terrorism in Governor House in Peshawar, Radio Pakistan reports. Sharif said the nation will fight the war against terrorism keeping in mind the faces of the innocent children who were subjected to the worst violence by terrorists in a school in Peshawar yesterday. Suspected Taliban militants detonated a suicide bomb then stormed a bank branch in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, Reuters reports. The militants engaged in a firefight with security forces while an unknown number of civilians were inside, police said. A Reuters witness at the scene heard the blast and the gunfire. Employees who escaped said that when the attack happened, the bank was busy with government workers who had come to collect their salaries. “According to our information, there were four Taliban, one of them detonated his explosives and three are fighting with security forces,” said Farid Ahmad Obaid, spokesman for Helmand’s police chief. Earlier the Afghan Taliban condemned the school attack in Peshawar, exposing divisions in the movement. Charlie Winter, a researcher on jihadism at London’s Quilliam Foundation has this translation of the Afghan Taliban’s condemnation of the Peshawar attack. The BBC’s Mishal Husain has tweeted some of the images from inside the school that she was describing earlier. And here’s the man outside the school, whose children escaped because they were playing cricket in the grounds: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has reintroduced the death penalty for terrorism related cases, in the wake of the school attack, according to Pakistani daily The Express Tribune. It reported that he had lifted a moratorium on capital punishment for such cases. BBC Radio 4’s Mishal Husain has become one of the first journalists to enter the school since the shooting. She describes bloodstains running down white stone steps leading to the building’s auditorium. On the way to the school she said she saw a small protest calling for a revenge against the Taliban. A man at the school gates, whose children escaped, asked Husain “where in the Qur’an does it say you can target children like this?” Guardian correspondent Jon Boone is on the quiet streets of Peshawar this morning. The streets are unusually empty on what is, on most days of the week, an overcrowded, choked city. A mourning period has been called here, and there are only a few people outside. But there are lots of funerals going on in this city today. We have just visited one, the joint funeral of two boys who lived together in the same part of town. We are now at the main military hospital in Peshawar, and there are hundreds of family members waiting here outside, for opening hours to start so they can go inside to see their injured children. Some of those in the hospital have relatively minor injuries, while others are in the critical care ward suffering gunshot wounds to their abdomens, or serious head injuries. We understand there are plans to move these critical cases to the country’s main military hospital in Rawalpindi. Boone says there are representatives of Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF), the charitable wing of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, out on the streets of Peshawar and at the city’s funerals, offering assistance and comfort to mourners. Jamaat-ud-Dawa is the public face of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a proscribed terrorist group. There will be lots of funerals like these in Peshawar today Imran Khan, Pakistan’s cricket captain-cum-iconoclastic political leader, has cancelled his planned nationwide shutdown for Thursday. Khan believes the 2013 election – which was a strong result for his previously-underperforming PTI party, but still delivered the PML(N)’s Nawaz Sharif a commanding majority – was rigged, and is demanding an independent audit of the poll. Khan’s party is in government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province of which Peshawar is the capital. His supporters had planned mass rallies and shutdowns that would “paralyse” Faisalbad, Karachi, Lahore and then the entire country, beginning Thursday. Khan, whose electoral symbol is a cricket bat, has immense personal popularity in Pakistan, for his cricketing deeds and his anti-corruption politics. He was visibly upset when he condemned the attack on the school. There is no justification for this. We are with the families of the victims. All of Pakistan is with them. Editorials from newspapers around the world expressed despair and anger at the massacre of the children. Here is part of the New York Times leader which highlights the Pakistan army’s complicated relationship with the Taliban: Wedded to an outmoded vision of India as the mortal enemy, the army has long played a double-game, taking American aid while supporting and exploiting various Taliban groups as a hedge against India and Afghanistan, and ignoring the peril that the militants have come to pose to Pakistan itself. The extent of cooperation among those groups in the tribal areas has made that game even riskier; the Pakistani military has long provided support for the Afghan-focused Taliban, even while trying to fight the Pakistani Taliban in recent years. Intelligence experts say the army is still collaborating with the Afghan Taliban in fighting the government in Kabul. To defeat the extremists, Pakistan will need more than a military strategy. It will need responsible governance and an acknowledgment by top leaders that they cannot contain attacks from one terrorist group while enabling another one. Lots of funerals are being held across Peshawar today. They began on Wednesday morning: Unconfirmed at this point, but this appears to be America’s initial response: Sherry Rehman’s sentiment is shared by many in Pakistan. The Pakistani government – in particular the military and its intelligence wing, the notorious ISI – has for decades been accused of covertly supporting the Taliban and its destabilising attacks over the border in Afghanistan. There is little appetite for conciliation or negotiation in Pakistan this morning. Husain Haqqani, another former Pakistan ambassador to the US, says Pakistan’s policies of tacitly allowing terrorists to operate from its soil has been “disastrous”. “The savage attack in Peshawar demonstrates the futility of attacking one group of jihadis while leaving others in place,” he writes. Reuters has just filed its latest dispatch from Peshawar: A day after the attack, Peshawar appeared subdued and many were still in shock, recalling the gruesome events and trying to soothe each other. More details of the well-organised attack emerged as witnesses came forward with their stories. “The attackers came around 10:30am on a pick-up van,” said Issam Uddin, a 25-year-old school bus driver. “They drove it around the back of the school and set it on fire to block the way. Then they went to gate 1 and killed a soldier, a gatekeeper and a gardener. Firing began and the first suicide attack took place.” Meanwhile politicians are beginning to ask what now needs to be done to stop the violence. “People will have to stop equivocating and come together in the face of national tragedy,” said Sherry Rehman, a former ambassador to the United States and an opposition politician. “There have been national leaders who been apologetic about the Taliban, who have not named the Taliban in their speeches.” Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (the Pakistani Taliban) should not be thought of as a single, homogenous organisation. Within the terror network, there are splinter factions and schisms that have been highlighted by the deaths of leaders (usually by US drone attack) and disagreements over tactics in negotiation with the Pakistani government. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan lacks the strong central command structure of its Afghan equivalent. Tuesday’s attack, in particular, has highlighted the division between Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban. “The intentional killing of innocent people, children and women is against the basics of Islam and this criteria has to be considered by every Islamic party and government,” Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement. And in the Wednesday English-language papers in Pakistan, the headlines are a mixture of outrage and despair: The reaction around the world is one of horror: A brief background on the city where yesterday’s horrific school attack took place: Peshawar, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, is about 180km west of Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, and less than 60km from the Afghan border. Historically, the frontier city has been a key transport route, the terminus of the Grand Trunk Road of India and a major depot for trade with Afghanistan. While it is only a little more than a two-hour drive from Islamabad, Peshawar is a very different city to the middle-class capital. On the edge of Pakistan’s “tribal belt”, Peshawar is poorer, jobs are hard to find and sectarian violence has steadily increased over recent years. Many Afghan refugees, displaced by decades of violence in their homeland, live in slums and camps in and around the city. This year, the World Health Organisation declared Peshawar the world’s “largest reservoir” of endemic polio. It is morning now in Pakistan, and soldiers are back on the grounds of the Army Public School in Peshawar, where 141 people, including 132 children, were murdered by the Pakistani Taliban. Pakistan has entered three days of mourning. Schoolchildren hold vigils for the students who were murdered in Peshawar: A candlelight vigil for the victims: The Pakistani Taliban says its attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar was retaliation for the military’s ongoing operation against its strongholds in the borderlands of North Waziristan. It wanted to kill the children of soldiers. “We selected the army’s school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females,” Taliban spokesman Muhammad Umar Khorasani said. “We want them to feel the pain.” In June, the Pakistani army launched “Zarb-e-Azb”, a “comprehensive operation against foreign and local terrorists who are hiding in sanctuaries in North Waziristan”. The “foreign” reference is to Afghan fighters. The lawless, mountainous regions of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are used as planning and staging areas for Taliban attacks across the two countries. After years of promising to drive militants from their hideaways, the Pakistani government has committed up to 30,000 troops to the operation. Pakistan believes it needs to secure the region before the end of Nato combat operations this year in Afghanistan. In Pakistan this morning, people are asking why was this attack allowed to happen. Rafia Zakaria from Dawn filed this excellent report on Pakistan’s schools of sorrow. Zakaria writes: Outrage is an easy emotion in Pakistan and after a decade of terrorist attacks almost a habit; when the tears dry up as tears do, little changes. Were we not locked into this cycle of act, outrage and forgetfulness, the imminence of an attack such as this one would have long been acknowledged, its probability seen as high, its likelihood necessitating preparation and security. There were numbers that told of the possibility; a report issued by the Global Coalition for the Protection of Education earlier this year noted that in the years between 2009 and 2012 there were 800 attacks on schools in Pakistan. Not one or two, but 800 warnings of the carnage to come, boxed away, set aside, pushed away to the back pages of newspapers, the recesses of consciousness. Shahrukh Khan, 16, was shot in both legs. He survived by playing dead as the gunmen roamed the school, shouting “Allahu Akbar” before opening fire. Khan said he felt a searing pain as he was shot in both legs, just below the knees. I saw a pair of big black boots coming towards me, this guy was probably hunting for students hiding beneath the benches. My body was shivering. I saw death so close and I will never forget the black boots approaching me – I felt as though it was death that was approaching me. I folded my tie and pushed it into my mouth so that I wouldn’t scream. The man with big boots kept on looking for students and pumping bullets into their bodies. I lay as still as I could and closed my eyes, waiting to get shot again. When I crawled to the next room, it was horrible. I saw the dead body of our office assistant on fire. She was sitting on the chair with blood dripping from her body as she burned. Khalid Khan, 13, was in a first-aid lesson in the main hall when two clean-shaven armed men wearing white clothes and black jackets entered the room. They opened fire at the students and then went out. The army doctor and soldiers managed to escape and we locked the doors from inside. But very soon they came, broke the doors and entered and again started firing. They killed most of my class mates and then I didn’t know what happened as I was brought to the hospital. Jalal Ahmed, 15, studied biochemistry. I was attending a lecture in our main hall. There are five doors in the hall. After some time we heard someone kicking the back doors. There were gun shots but our teacher told us to be quiet and calmed us down. Then the men came with big guns. Standing next to Ahmed’s hospital bed, his father, Mushtaq Ahmed, said: “He keeps screaming: ‘take me home, take me home, they will come back and kill me’.” One nine-year-old boy, who asked not to be named because he was too afraid to be identified, said teachers shepherded his class out through a back door as soon as the shooting began. The teacher asked us to recite from the Koran quietly. When we came out from the back door there was a crowd of parents who were crying. When I saw my father he was also crying. Reportage from AFP, Reuters, Al Jazeera and AP. US president Barack Obama described the gunmen’s assault as “heinous”. “Our hearts and prayers go out to the victims, their families and loved ones. By targeting students and teachers in this heinous attack, terrorists have once again shown their depravity.” Afghanistan’s president Ashraf Ghani said the attack was un-Islamic. “The killing of innocent children is contrary to Islam.” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said in a series of tweeted statements: “It is a senseless act of unspeakable brutality that has claimed lives of the most innocent of human beings – young children in their school.” British prime minister David Cameron told reporters the attack was “a dark, dark day for humanity ... There is not a belief system in the world that can justify such an act. I think what this shows is the worldwide threat that is posed by this poisonous ideology of extremist Islamist terrorism. It is nothing to do with one of the world’s great religions – Islam, which is a religion of peace. This is a perversion.” German chancellor Angela Merkel said: “The news of the terrorist attack on a school in Peshawar has shaken me deeply. The hostage-taking and murder of children and youth is barbarity that cannot be surpassed”. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said he could not find words to describe his sorrow. “It is simply impossible to put into words the mixture of grief and fury that must be felt by people in Pakistan and indeed around the world at this latest terrorist atrocity.” Education campaigner and Nobel peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012, has condemned the “atrocious and cowardly” attack on the school. I am heartbroken by this senseless and cold-blooded act of terror in Peshawar that is unfolding before us. Innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this. I condemn these atrocious and cowardly acts and stand united with the government and armed forces of Pakistan whose efforts so far to address this horrific event are commendable. I, along with millions of others around the world, mourn these children, my brothers and sisters – but we will never be defeated. The Pakistani Taliban killed 141 people, including 132 children, in an attack on an army-run school in Peshawar, a city in the country’s north-west. The attack was one of the deadliest in Pakistan’s history. Pakistani special forces mounted a rescue operation and battled the militants in the school, ending the siege and clearing the building of explosives. The army said there were seven terrorists, all wearing suicide jackets, and that the militants sought no demands but only to kill students. Prime minister Nawaz Sharif travelled to Peshawar and the army launched at least 10 air strikes on the Taliban. Sharif called the attack a national tragedy and promised to eradicate the terrorists. “These are my children and it is my loss,” he said. He announced three days of national mourning. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan said it attacked the army-run school in retaliation for a government offensive in the north: “This is a reaction to the killing of our children and dumping of bodies of our mujahideen,” a spokesman said. Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the injured and dead, and survivors have recounted horrific episodes of the assault. Jon Boone’s extraordinary reportage of the Peshawar attack is here. He writes: “Seven men wearing bomb vests climbed over an undefended wall and began a pitiless killing spree.” The Guardian’s front page. Jon Boone in Peshawar: “We didn’t move because whoever moved got shot at.” Many of the photos being circulated are very graphic. The Guardian has chosen not to publish those. Harrowing pictures are emerging on social media from Peshawar yesterday Pakistan, a country more damaged by terrorism than almost any other on Earth, is waking up this morning, still in disbelief at a brutal attack on its children as they sat in classrooms. The latest information says that at least 141 people – 132 schoolchildren and nine staff members - were killed in the militant attack on an army-run school in Peshawar. Most of the victims were teenagers. Just after 12pm Tuesday Pakistan time, up to seven unidentified men opened fire on students and teachers at the Army Public School in Warsak Road, Peshawar, in north-west Pakistan. It is the worst terrorist attack in Pakistan in seven years, and has left a country in mourning, and a world in shock. The Pakistani military has vowed to continue its offensive against the Taliban strongholds in the north-west of the country. The Express Tribune reported: “It is our 9/11. It’s an attack on Pakistan’s future, its young sons and daughters.” “The smallest of coffins are the heaviest to carry,” the father of one Pakistan’s young victims said.

As I still have a young family – my youngest is five – Christmas is important to me and I’ll be at home with my family on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. We do try and look after each other on our team; we try to create Christmas off for those with kids.</p> <p>I’ll be working on <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mad-friday-picture-special-thousands-6437800\">Mad Friday</a>, 19 December, the busiest Friday night of the year in the city centre, and on New Year’s Eve. I’m not the only inspector in the city centre, but working on New Year’s Eve comes with the territory. I’ll be clocking on at 7pm and will work through to 6am. It’s flat out, so there’s no formal break - there isn’t time. But I get a break over Christmas; I don’t need anyone to get a hanky out for me.</p> <p><strong>What’s Mad Friday all about?</strong></p> <p>Mad Friday is the last Friday before Christmas. People have finished work and the city is awash with people on works dos and a lot of people get paid early for Christmas, so put all that in the mix and you get Mad Friday. We’ve got more than 500 licensed premises in 2.2 sq miles, and it’s always more than 100,000 people, so it’s hard. The Manchester Evening News came out with us last year and got some <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mad-friday-picture-special-thousands-6437800\">gruesome pics</a>. </p> <p><strong>Who do you work with?</strong><br></p> <p>I work with our neighbourhood policing team; this weekend and on New Year’s Eve we’ll have a team of at least 100 officers on the street, most of them on foot, in yellow jackets, in areas where we know we’ll be busy. We also have specialist resources, including our mounted officers and tactical aid unit (don’t call them the riot police). </p> <p>We deal with absolutely everything, other than the most serious crime. But this isn’t just about a police operation. Bar staff and door supervisors do a really good job of preventing a lot of the trouble. It’s a huge partnership. We’ve got the council CCTV room and the council provides taxi marshals, and there are a number of street angels – volunteers who go out in teams and look after vulnerable people – including the <a href=\"http://www.lgf.org.uk/angels\">Village Angels</a>, provided by the Lesbian and Gay Foundation and the <a href=\"http://www.sa-cni.org.uk/blog/manchesters-nightlife-is-made-safer-as-the-first-teams-of-street-angels-patrol-the-city-centre\">Manchester Street Angels</a>. They go out in teams. If someone’s lost a heel off a shoe, they provide flip-flops, or a mobile phone battery, or if someone’s got separated from their friends, they’ll get them a taxi. </p> <p><strong>What are the busiest times of the New Year’s Eve shift?</strong></p> <p>There’s that incredibly busy period from 11:30pm to 1am when people are moving to or from bars or the public display in Piccadilly Gardens. Other than that we typically see a shift at 2 or 3am from what I call happy drunk to nasty drunk and that becomes very challenging because we will have lost resources as we’ve been making arrests and dealing with victims, and we’re managing people who have become more vulnerable and more aggressive. We’ll still be on foot in the city centre at six in the morning.</p> <p><strong>How busy will the Christmas period be for those on duty?</strong></p> <p>We will have a limited number of staff on duty on Christmas Day and we’ll bring in extra on Boxing Day. We’re not expecting a rerun of the nonsense we saw here on Black Friday, when we made eight arrests. We’re not expecting Boxing Day to generate that kind of frenzy. But Boxing Day is a little unusual this year because it’s on a Friday. We would normally have a limited number of staff out on a bank holiday, but we’ve got Boxing Day sales, Manchester United versus Newcastle at 3pm and then a lot of people, especially young people, who will want to come out rather than playing charades with their families! So we’re running a full night-time economy operation on Boxing Day night. <br></p> <p><strong>What’s the worst thing about working over the holidays?</strong></p> <p>The hardest thing is not to become jaundiced by seeing people at their worst. It’s about vulnerability, victims and villains and I have to remind the staff that 99.9% of people who come out are decent. Our job is to look after them and get them home safely and stop that 0.1% spoiling things. One New Year’s Eve, as on all weekends, 99.9% of people will come out and have a great time and get home safely.<br></p> <p><strong>And the best thing?</strong></p> <p>Because we are out on the streets we will talk to people, especially on New Year’s Eve, and have positive interactions. Manchester is a fantastic place to live and work. I’ve been here 20 years now and I’m incredibly fortunate. We’re based in the town hall now as part of our integrated neighbourhood work, with council staff working in our offices. So if we have a nuisance with licensing or noise, we can have that conversation with colleagues across the desk. And I’m literally looking out at our Christmas market. </p> <p><strong>What’s your biggest worry this Christmas time?</strong></p> <p>Everybody is struggling with shrinking resources, us and our partners. Demand is going up, but resources are shrinking. The reality is that our force is going from 8,000 officers to 6,000 officers, and we send our community officers out with a radio and a stab vest and not a lot else. We’re here to look after the public and ourselves and sometimes that’s a struggle. </p> <p><strong>And your favourite time of the year?</strong><br></p> <p>Summer.

I’m one of four police inspectors in Manchester’s city centre neighbourhood policing team. As I still have a young family – my youngest is five – Christmas is important to me and I’ll be at home with my family on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. We do try and look after each other on our team; we try to create Christmas off for those with kids. I’ll be working on Mad Friday, 19 December, the busiest Friday night of the year in the city centre, and on New Year’s Eve. I’m not the only inspector in the city centre, but working on New Year’s Eve comes with the territory. I’ll be clocking on at 7pm and will work through to 6am. It’s flat out, so there’s no formal break - there isn’t time. But I get a break over Christmas; I don’t need anyone to get a hanky out for me. What’s Mad Friday all about? Mad Friday is the last Friday before Christmas. People have finished work and the city is awash with people on works dos and a lot of people get paid early for Christmas, so put all that in the mix and you get Mad Friday. We’ve got more than 500 licensed premises in 2.2 sq miles, and it’s always more than 100,000 people, so it’s hard. The Manchester Evening News came out with us last year and got some gruesome pics. Who do you work with? I work with our neighbourhood policing team; this weekend and on New Year’s Eve we’ll have a team of at least 100 officers on the street, most of them on foot, in yellow jackets, in areas where we know we’ll be busy. We also have specialist resources, including our mounted officers and tactical aid unit (don’t call them the riot police). We deal with absolutely everything, other than the most serious crime. But this isn’t just about a police operation. Bar staff and door supervisors do a really good job of preventing a lot of the trouble. It’s a huge partnership. We’ve got the council CCTV room and the council provides taxi marshals, and there are a number of street angels – volunteers who go out in teams and look after vulnerable people – including the Village Angels, provided by the Lesbian and Gay Foundation and the Manchester Street Angels. They go out in teams. If someone’s lost a heel off a shoe, they provide flip-flops, or a mobile phone battery, or if someone’s got separated from their friends, they’ll get them a taxi. What are the busiest times of the New Year’s Eve shift? There’s that incredibly busy period from 11:30pm to 1am when people are moving to or from bars or the public display in Piccadilly Gardens. Other than that we typically see a shift at 2 or 3am from what I call happy drunk to nasty drunk and that becomes very challenging because we will have lost resources as we’ve been making arrests and dealing with victims, and we’re managing people who have become more vulnerable and more aggressive. We’ll still be on foot in the city centre at six in the morning. How busy will the Christmas period be for those on duty? We will have a limited number of staff on duty on Christmas Day and we’ll bring in extra on Boxing Day. We’re not expecting a rerun of the nonsense we saw here on Black Friday, when we made eight arrests. We’re not expecting Boxing Day to generate that kind of frenzy. But Boxing Day is a little unusual this year because it’s on a Friday. We would normally have a limited number of staff out on a bank holiday, but we’ve got Boxing Day sales, Manchester United versus Newcastle at 3pm and then a lot of people, especially young people, who will want to come out rather than playing charades with their families! So we’re running a full night-time economy operation on Boxing Day night. What’s the worst thing about working over the holidays? The hardest thing is not to become jaundiced by seeing people at their worst. It’s about vulnerability, victims and villains and I have to remind the staff that 99.9% of people who come out are decent. Our job is to look after them and get them home safely and stop that 0.1% spoiling things. One New Year’s Eve, as on all weekends, 99.9% of people will come out and have a great time and get home safely. And the best thing? Because we are out on the streets we will talk to people, especially on New Year’s Eve, and have positive interactions. Manchester is a fantastic place to live and work. I’ve been here 20 years now and I’m incredibly fortunate. We’re based in the town hall now as part of our integrated neighbourhood work, with council staff working in our offices. So if we have a nuisance with licensing or noise, we can have that conversation with colleagues across the desk. And I’m literally looking out at our Christmas market. What’s your biggest worry this Christmas time? Everybody is struggling with shrinking resources, us and our partners. Demand is going up, but resources are shrinking. The reality is that our force is going from 8,000 officers to 6,000 officers, and we send our community officers out with a radio and a stab vest and not a lot else. We’re here to look after the public and ourselves and sometimes that’s a struggle. And your favourite time of the year? Summer. I like summer because Manchester is a great city and it’s even more alive in the summer. Piccadilly Gardens, which I manage, is a challenge for many reasons, but on a warm summer’s day with thousands of people having lunch and enjoying being out – that’s good.

The call comes after Bercow told MPs in September that he was pausing the recruitment process for a new clerk when MPs objected to the appointment of Mills on the grounds that she did not know enough about parliamentary privilege and procedure. A report published on Wednesday by the House of Commons governance committee recommends that two roles be created: the clerk of the House of Commons, who would advise MPs on parliamentary procedure and who would not hold the title of chief executive, and a director general, who would run Commons services and report to the clerk. The committee, which is chaired by the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, also recommends that the paused recruitment process for a replacement for Sir Robert Rogers, who left the role in August, be terminated and started again for the two new roles.

David Blunkett, the former home secretary, who is stepping down from the Commons next May, said the report’s proposals did not go far enough and represented a disappointing compromise. He said: “Making a new post of chief operating officer is a minor step forward but subordinating the management of the Commons to the undoubtedly valued role of the clerk of the house, responsible for process and constitutional issues, is a reflection of the conservatism of the past rather than addressing the challenges of the future. “What was really needed was a highly experienced, respected chief executive whilst retaining the standing and therefore the status of the separate appointment of the clerk. I think the new parliament will come to regret that the committee did not bite the bullet.” The suggested appointment of Mills to the role proved controversial.

But that’s too simple a metaphor. Imagine instead nine soccer fields laid in three rows of three, with 198 8-year-old players running after all of those balls, irrespective of origin, and just trying to shoot. Plays happen in bursts, with no resolution. The score can only go higher, but no one can win, and the game will never end. You are one of the parents, and you hate many of the other parents. Also, your iPhone battery is dead. </p> <p>Cable news is the soccer game where both teams lose but the rich kids still get to go out for pizza anyway.</p> <p>Some critics credit viral social media news with intensifying this phenomenon – here is a <a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/judge-rules-dead-deer-sex\">Midwestern man who tried to avoid prosecution for sex with a deer because it was dead</a> or a <a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-man-who-had-sex-with-sheep-246520\">West Midlands sheep rapist</a> you would never have heard about, “Like” this picture to receive more stories from BLASTHOLE MEDIA – but that’s letting the media off too easy. The boundless space of the internet allows for room to print stories’ resolutions; links join the sensational start of a news item to its less spectacular – but more soothing – end. There is a feeling of wholeness; an event may have been insensible, but its context makes sense.</p> <p>You will not find that on cable news. Because it is part of my job, I watched more CNN than ever in 2014, and I am the dumber for it. I am more convinced than ever that CNN’s purpose is to let you know that something is on fire and that Gloria Borger does <em>not </em>like the way that the men fleeing the building – screaming, and trying to put out the blaze in their mustaches with frenzied Stooge-slaps to their agonized faces – will impact, say, Rick Santorum in 2016.</p> <p>Because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/04/eric-garner-mike-brown-fox-news-megyn-kelly\">my editors hate me</a> (more proof <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/20/paul-ryan-new-book-2016-conservative-policy\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/30/sarah-palin-channel-problems\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/11/iraq-fear-mongering-john-mccain-sunday-shows-war\">here</a>), they asked me to remember what happened in 2014 – as I experienced it on CNN.

The 24-hour cable news media resembles a group of kids playing soccer: there is no strategy, just a raw, run, get it response. But that’s too simple a metaphor. Imagine instead nine soccer fields laid in three rows of three, with 198 8-year-old players running after all of those balls, irrespective of origin, and just trying to shoot. Plays happen in bursts, with no resolution. The score can only go higher, but no one can win, and the game will never end. You are one of the parents, and you hate many of the other parents. Also, your iPhone battery is dead. Cable news is the soccer game where both teams lose but the rich kids still get to go out for pizza anyway. Some critics credit viral social media news with intensifying this phenomenon – here is a Midwestern man who tried to avoid prosecution for sex with a deer because it was dead or a West Midlands sheep rapist you would never have heard about, “Like” this picture to receive more stories from BLASTHOLE MEDIA – but that’s letting the media off too easy. The boundless space of the internet allows for room to print stories’ resolutions; links join the sensational start of a news item to its less spectacular – but more soothing – end. There is a feeling of wholeness; an event may have been insensible, but its context makes sense. You will not find that on cable news. Because it is part of my job, I watched more CNN than ever in 2014, and I am the dumber for it. I am more convinced than ever that CNN’s purpose is to let you know that something is on fire and that Gloria Borger does not like the way that the men fleeing the building – screaming, and trying to put out the blaze in their mustaches with frenzied Stooge-slaps to their agonized faces – will impact, say, Rick Santorum in 2016. Because my editors hate me (more proof here and here and here), they asked me to remember what happened in 2014 – as I experienced it on CNN. If journalism is the first draft of history, this is the one the professor hands back to you marked “see me after class”. JANUARY Nothing happened in January because it was too cold. FEBRUARY What Happened: Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in Sochi. This was very bad, because many journalists were forced to sit on upside-down toilet seats or use undersized closets or order food they didn’t like off misprinted menus. The streets were filled with dogs, which are the grown-up versions of puppies (slideshows of which can restore your faith in humanity). Temperatures were high, which caused the whole mountain to get wet, and many skiers died. The whole thing may also have been a Potemkin Village erected by an autocrat. What May Actually Have Happened: It was a Potemkin Village erected by an autocrat at ridiculous expense to both people and dogs. MARCH What Happened: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared and then it stayed disappeared, for days actually. CNN anchor Don Lemon wasn’t sure if it disappeared into a black hole. Literally nothing else was happening at the same time – except Russia formally annexed Crimea, which NATO might have had to start the Third World War over, according Representative Peter King, Senator John McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham and assorted CNN mainstays who look like a kindergarten production of the Prussian General Staff. What May Actually Have Happened: Our world was not obliterated by a black hole. Also no one ever found the plane. APRIL What Happened: Despite strong opposition from Ann Coulter, who almost stopped it, Michelle Obama and you – Citizen Hashtagger – #broughtbackourgirls with tweets. You did it. You stopped Joseph Kony. What May Actually Have Happened: The girls were not brought back. MAY What Happened: The Thai army overthrew the government, but because it was a military-backed coup unaffiliated with communism, America’s response to Southeast Asia remained a committed “whatever”. Polio made a global comeback; however, since America has a vaccine for polio and it doesn’t sound African, it was impossible to tie it to a conspiracy directed by Barack Obama to poison Americans and seize control of the country – despite the fact that, by contracting polio himself, Obama could have theoretically transformed into Franklin Delano Roosevelt and changed the political make-up of the US supreme court. What May Actually Have Happened: Everything but the FDR stuff actually happened. Also, the US imposed economic sanctions against Russia, for the Ukraine thing. JUNE What Happened: Germany won the World Cup in Brazil in stadiums built on bulldozed poor neighborhoods, horrific income inequality and preposterous government largesse. Also, pageantry! And Pitbull! What May Actually Have Happened: In a continuing trend, Last Week Tonight with Jon Oliver covered World Cup politics better than almost anyone on TV. (Although Dave Zirin appears on MSNBC, and he wrote this.) Some grade-A thinkpiece-y social justice material about how governments spend more on this shit than keeping their people alive or under roofs was probably withheld from broadcast to make sure viewers wouldn’t be bored by it while watching the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. JULY What Happened: With all the gravitas of Geraldo Rivera discovering the secret of Al Capone’s vaults, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer smiled and nodded and repeated keywords he heard from an IDF representative seconds before being led on a tour of Hamas tunnels into Israel during rocket attacks against targets in Gaza. Wolf went on to monitor the situation in Operation Protective Edge very closely, eventually debuting a new machine that can generate false equivalencies at a ratio of one per every one sentence. What May Actually Have Happened: Americans were given the clear message that, “Whatever it was, Hamas started it.” AUGUST What Happened: In Northern Iraq, Isis surrounded and besieged ethnic and religious minorities, including Yazidis and Christians. The Christians among them sent out waves of Christianosity to the surrounding group members, endowing them with special Founding Fathers Lifeforce, which is detectable only by Americans in a state of negative liberty. President Barack Obama was castigated for not rescuing the by now “Yazidi Christians”, who hudded on top of the same mountain that Moses came down after God handed him the Constitution. Also, Ferguson, Missouri was going to burn down any minute. What May Actually Have Happened: Obama temporarily rescued the Christians, but did not defeat Isis, because he was too distracted from not-winning the Third World War in Ukraine. Ferguson did not burn down, but an unarmed 18-year-old boy was shot dead in the streets and the local police seemed more interested in drenching the outraged citizenry in tear gas. SEPTEMBER What Happened: Dozens of celebrity nudes were stolen and illegally posted on the internet by a “man” named “4Chan”, who may have been a “system administrator”. Many of the images came from iCloud accounts, which are Apple accounts, and Apple is the 51st American state, and it is bad when bad things happen to Apple. Meanwhile, host of CNN’s Reliable Sources Brian Stelter defended fellow CNN host Fareed Zakaria against yet more allegations of plagiarism. What May Actually Have Happened: Once again, your technology news was brought to you by your dad, who pays $19.99/month for an AOL membership on top of $54.99/month for broadband. Also, Fareed Zakaria is a plagiarist. And also maybe if women don’t want you to see them naked don’t go trying to find pictures of them because that makes you garbage. OCTOBER What Happened: Ebola can kill you and is going to kill you. What May Actually Have Happened: Ebola wasn’t going to kill you and didn’t. NOVEMBER What Happened: Obama’s policies suffered a devastating loss and confirmed that the American people have given the GOP a mandate. Anchor Don Lemon came up with a new kind of rape deterrent. What May Actually Have Happened: The Democrats pushed Obama aside, ran away from their own legislative accomplishments, suffered from an off-year election in which the GOP normally sees greater turnout and lost in many lower-population, historically red states that Obama also lost in 2012 anyway. Don Lemon is still a massive idiot. DECEMBER What Is Happening: Lower oil prices and western economic sanctions are causing the value of the rouble to plummet, causing a run on consumer goods while Putin faces a loss of the only thing that’s kept him in power, whimsy and beefcake photos this long: economic stability. He may decide to start World War Three, which Obama could have won already if he’d only started it in March when the GOP Chickenhawk Squadron told him to. What Will Actually Happen: You’re going to eat too much at Christmas. So there you have it: the world and hysterical catastrophe journalism where anchors go on location to interview other anchors rather than anyone else involved have come a long way in the last year. It’d be silly not to expect more. Like the retraction buried on A20 two weeks after the scandalous headline above the fold on A1, the full story isn’t sexy, and it isn’t worth sticking around for. Nobody’s watching every night to see them fail to #BringBackOurGirls. But you can make a lot of something from nothing – even specific ratings surges from the explanation and search for nothing, or the existential threat of nothing.

It is believed that Bevan had suffered from schizophrenia and depression. Investigators will look at whether she may have made changes to medication she was taking so she could breastfeed her baby. Coincidentally, on Wednesday Nice released new guidelines saying women at risk of mental health problems or with existing conditions should receive more support at every stage of pregnancy and after childbirth. According to the new guidelines, potential mothers-to-be with new, existing or past mental health problems should be advised on how pregnancy and childbirth could affect their mental wellbeing. Mental health professionals should provide detailed advice on benefits or risks to a woman, foetus or baby associated with drug treatments at each stage of pregnancy.","charCount":"3435"},"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/musicblog/2014/dec/17/boybands-10-of-the-best-take-that-wanted-blue-new-kids","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T13:18:52Z","webTitle":"Boybands: 10 of the best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/17/boybands-10-of-the-best-take-that-wanted-blue-new-kids","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/17/boybands-10-of-the-best-take-that-wanted-blue-new-kids","fields":{"headline":"Boybands: 10 of the best","standfirst":"<p>From the Monkees’ scornful takedown of a social-climbing ex-girlfriend to a soft-pop humdinger penned by Gary Barlow in 15 minutes, here are 10 songs that prove being screamed at doesn’t make you talentless</p>","trailText":"<strong>Caroline Sullivan:</strong> From the Monkees’ scornful takedown of a social-climbing ex-girlfriend to a soft-pop humdinger penned by Gary Barlow in 15 minutes, here are 10 songs that prove being screamed at doesn’t make you talentless","byline":"Caroline Sullivan","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fc0e12463034aa4500a669c81cc2156895bd182\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418818545984/89915312-f4a1-4d9e-874f-585b9144dcbf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wham!\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wham! … young guns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2>1 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUdIKdRuYc4\">The Monkees – (I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone</a></h2> <p> Some contend that the Beatles were the first boyband, but the Monkees were the first group purpose-built to actually be one – or to play the part of one, anyway, in the eponymous 1960s sitcom. The band themselves thought they’d been hired to portray “a rock’n’roll band”, as Mike Nesmith put it, but they were a boyband by default – their boyish looks and chipper pop-rock attracted a huge constituency of young girls. Steppin’ Stone was the B-side of I’m a Believer but also became a single in its own right in late 1966. It couldn’t be more different from the jaunty I’m a Believer. The twangy guitar and disdainful, spat-out vocals are closer to Merseybeat, or perhaps the raw early Kinks, and the lyrics are a scornful takedown of a social-climbing ex-girlfriend. In the fade-out, singer Micky Dolenz – the only Monkee who actually appears on it, everything else being played by session musicians – screams himself into hysteria. It’s not hard to see why the Sex Pistols would later cover it.</p> <h2>2 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvmqYZr0RFo\">Jackson 5 – Never Can Say Goodbye </a></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSvNZWpXaM\">Gloria Gaynor’s disco version</a>, recorded three years after the Jacksons hit No 1 with this song, better captures the spirit of the lyrics: few could have surpassed the queen of disco as she squared up to the cheating partner she couldn’t bring herself to leave. Michael Jackson, by contrast, hadn’t reached his 12th birthday when the Jacksons made Never Can Say Goodbye in 1971, and couldn’t address the subject with Gaynor’s fervour. What sells the Jackson 5 version is exactly what Gaynor’s take lacked: innocence, optimism and the purity of his 11-year-old voice. Even when he hits the pain-crescendo of “There’s that same unhappy feeling, there’s that anguish, there’s that doubt,” he blithely coasts through it. Well, when you’re 11, “anguish” is something you feel when your new bike gets a puncture. Yet the track is stunning: Michael’s performance is glorious, his brothers’ harmonies spot-on and the subtle backing track is garlanded by a darting flute riff. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bcdd6579a5309fb87bc525ffb9aac5c8743a1da\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418752127132/5ce34aaa-dbf0-433f-8658-472d3907e37a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jackson 5\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jackson 5 … family entertainment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neal Preston/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yRZ6UmVTbc\">Slik – Forever and Ever</a></h2> <p>The earlier success of Edinburgh’s Bay City Rollers gave fellow Scots Slik a boost. The Glasgow foursome duly seized their moment in 1976 with Forever and Ever, written by former BCR songwriters Bill Martin and Phil Coulter. It’s a curio influenced by early 60s “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_tragedy_song\">teenage tragedy</a>” songs; you could also argue that its doominess prefigured goth by several years. It starts with a funereal church organ, and the atmosphere is further chilled by a tolling bell and faux-Gregorian chanting. Eventually, singer Midge Ure – making his first appearance on a hit single – gloomily chimes in with: “As it was in the beginning, then so should it end / Don’t let a lover become just a friend.” Those first 40 seconds are possibly the most melodramatic ever recorded by a 70s boyband – when the incongruously bouncy chorus finally kicks in, it does little to lighten the mood. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKizUha9wm4\">An earlier version of the song</a> by contemporaneous boyband Kenny, by contrast, takes the song up-tempo, to its detriment.) There’s religious imagery throughout – “Ashes to ashes, dust to dust / Will love last forever? I know that it must” – and the wonder is that this actually reached No 1, briefly establishing them as major players. The follow-up, Requiem, was also strikingly desolate, proving heavy going even for the teenage girls who’d bought the first single; it only reached No 24 and Slik never had another hit.</p> <h2>4 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmWN1H3XASI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmWN1H3XASI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmWN1H3XASI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmWN1H3XASI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmWN1H3XASI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmWN1H3XASI\">Bay City Rollers – You Made Me Believe in Magic</a> </h2> <p>Slik’s predecessors, the premier boyband of the 70s, weren’t the musical wimps their detractors claimed. There was a proto-punk snarl to some of their singles, they dabbled in disco on others and in 1977 they executed a complete change of direction. Harry Maslin, who’d just produced David Bowie’s Station to Station, was brought in to oversee their new album, It’s a Game, and he gave them a Philly-soul makeover that made them sound like a different band. This song is heavy with synths, strings and horns, yet light on its feet. Just two-and-a-half minutes long, it breezes in and breezes out again, piloted by Les McKeown’s airy lead vocal. During the middle eight, guitarist Eric Faulkner whips off a creditably funky break, and the rhythm section is spot on. Sadly, the Rollers were in decline by then, and the song lacked the anthemic chantalong quality of earlier smashes like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytii7-bUxuk\">Shang-a-Lang</a> (which, by the way, influenced the embryonic Sex Pistols). Consequently, it was too slick for their remaining fans, too lightweight for their older siblings. Though it made the top 10 in North America, it was their lowest-charting single in Britain, its sophistication falling on deaf ears. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb61739920e142cfed205029679af5917c3266ff\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418752227209/ebbbe2cc-aa6a-4ed6-b338-792cc3652fed-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bay City Rollers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bay City Rollers … Wicker men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNX3xA3wx5c\">Wham! – Young Guns (Go for It)</a></h2> <p>Though best remembered as the testbed for George Michael’s solo career, Wham! were extravagantly endowed with pop nous. Michael and pretty-boy bandmate Andrew Ridgeley had exactly the right payload of cuteness and feigned naughtiness, and 19-year-old songwriter Michael had an astonishing grasp of melody and dynamics. On their first two records, he also steered away from the usual boyband lyrical preoccupations: debut single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpBuHO2gxHc\">Wham Rap!</a> was about youth unemployment, and Young Guns warned of the danger of settling down too young. Michael’s lyrics pitilessly highlighted the reality of teenage marriage: “A married man? You’re out of your head / Sleepless nights on an HP bed / A daddy by the time you’re 21/ If you’re happy with a nappy then you’re in for fun.” Though the song sounds dated – its bleating synth refrain has “1982” written all over it, and “HP bed” will baffle anyone under 40 – it’s still tremendously propulsive. What really lifts it to glory is the vocal duel between Ridgeley and backing singer Shirlie Holliman (later of Pepsi &amp; Shirlie). Playing the young bride-to-be, she sneers at Michael: “Tell this jerk to take a hike!” Groom Ridgeley vainly tries to placate her (“Sugar, he don’t mean the things he said!”), and the whole song combusts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Boybands\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:4Ybq2PD5saqzdt8ir1v5B5\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeF1rt9juwM\">Bros – Drop the Boy</a></h2> <p>The opening words of this 1988 single – “I get down to dry my hair with a little touch of gel” – aren’t the ones Bros’s manager wanted. His suggestion was that they start the song with “Hair covers my body, and my muscles feel like steel”. Concerned that their young female audience, known as Brosettes, might be nonplussed – none of the band looked as if they had hair anywhere except on their heads – they nixed the idea and opted for the less smutty line. Even without that knowledge, which really perks up the song for me, I would have loved this track. Released while <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/signed-sealed-delivered-he-had-it-all-he-lost-it-all-all-that-stops-his-being-the-classic-pop-music-story-is-that-luke-goss-has-lived-to-tell-the-tale-jim-white-talks-to-the-drummer-who-was-bros-1458109.html\">Bros were at their short-lived peak</a>, it’s a splendid example of attitude plus technology. It opened with a flurry of synth drums, which gave way to three minutes of compressed keyboard wonkiness that sounds like something experimental poppers <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/propaganda-mn0000309217/biography\">Propaganda</a> might have cooked up. (The three Bros members played conventional guitars and drums, but it’s nigh on impossible to detect them amid the synthesised squees and braps of the backing track.) Then there was Matt Goss’s baby-panther snarl as he demanded to be treated like a man rather than a boy. “I’m tired of the boy thing, I’ve got other things to do,” he growled. “I’d like to be in politics, can’t take another trip to the zoo.” The fact that he sounded about 15 – he was actually 19 – makes it even more piquant. Marvellous.</p> <h2>7 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku3K7Pqu_EE\">New Kids on the Block – Dirty Dawg</a><br></h2> <p>A wonderfully idiotic song that owes a good deal to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuyS9M8T03A\">George Clinton’s Atomic Dog</a>, in terms of swampy funkiness, not to mention barking sound effects. The New Kids put a truculent 90s spin on the theme of an unfaithful partner being no better than a dog, muttering: “Don’t think you can jerk me around / Now your ass is in the pound.” A mid-song rap by hip-hop duo Nice &amp; Smooth extends the canine metaphor, listing the brands of dog food the wronged narrator was saving up for his two-timing sweetie: “Here’s the ChuckWagon … here’s the Ken-L Ration and the Alpo too.” Given that New Kids’ audience was teenage girls, it’s striking how full-throttle this song is: the band’s tough-guy act feels like the real thing here, especially when they pile into the rumbling chorus (“Dawg! Dirty dawg! Oh, you’re so damn dirty”). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"372ea522f77306f3110d56485b1e752f2f1eecb0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418753900494/17505375-f576-4753-92e7-bf477a206892-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"New Kids on the Block\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Kids on the Block … full-throttle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/Redferns via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ICtCO8TCw\">Take That – Back for Good</a> </h2> <p>There’s a case to be made for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH9Cti06nsI\">Robbie Williams’s solo version</a> of this strummy acoustic 1995 smash, which he covered on his first few tours after leaving Take That. He did it as a Ramonesesque punk howl – his little way of sticking two fingers up at its writer, Gary Barlow, and distancing himself from his ex-band’s soft-centred balladry. But the original, featuring Barlow’s doe-eyed lead vocal and cascading harmonies from the other four, is just as succulent. Say what you like about Barlow, but he inarguably has a gift for melody and arrangement, and Back for Good, which he claims to have written in 15 minutes, is one of his finest. It’s become a classic guilty pleasure for people who wouldn’t normally admit to liking a soft-pop love song – but why feel guilty? There’s something about the way Barlow’s voice shoots up an octave as he delivers the line “Got a fist of pure emotion” that makes the song easy to relate to.</p> <h2>9 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkWQDDv_qdg\">Blue – All Rise </a> <br></h2> <p>Though Blue were conceived as the Brit answer to late-90s US teen titans<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/01/nsync-will-never-reunite\"> N Sync</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6samPEMpM\">Backstreet Boys</a>, their first single ploughed its own furrow. All Rise had few of the elements that defined boyband music at the time: no hip-hoppy swagger, no glossy in-the-club beats. Instead, it’s understated R&amp;B with a trace of folk, and accented by that least cool of instruments, the accordion. If singer/MC Simon Webbe hadn’t dropped a superfluous rap into the middle – most boybands of the era had a rapping member who injected grit as required – it could have been a lost 60s single. Distinctive and moreish, it’s a fantastic debut; 13 years later, it’s still a one-off – as different from the usual boyband run of things as accordions are from synthesisers (though both were used on the song). And although the girl-cheats-on-boy subject matter is familiar, there’s a cute twist: the song is set in a courtroom, where the girl is on “trial” for lying (and wearing bad hair extensions, no doubt). “Objection overruled … the jury will decide … I rest my case!” they sing ringingly. It was a song that was hard to top, and they never did. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcb4561383e8f7a0b7bc36d87e47fb4d9898de71\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418754576165/c254c666-20a3-4333-a4bf-0921b3d6f3ed-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Blue\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue winning the best newcomers’ prize at the Smash Hits poll winners party in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiEEJds8JFE\">The Wanted – Glad You Came</a></h2> <p>A significant problem faced by modern British boybands is the genre’s narrow musical parameters. On the one hand, there’s the pop-rock of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mLKQgP8pdM\">McBusted</a> and the Vamps; on the other, the rinsed-out R&amp;B of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSMPTzCW28U\">Kingsland Road</a>. Any group that diverges from those templates sounds wildly original, which is why Glad You Came, by British/Irish quintet the Wanted, is the only post-2010 song on this list. As with Blue’s All Rise, accordion plays a central part on the Wanted’s 2011 single, giving it a dash of cartoon-French melancholy, and the lyrics cleverly interlock, with each song-line starting with the last word of the previous line. It doesn’t sound impressive in print, but hearing it (“Turn the lights out now / Now I’ll take you by the hand / Hand you another drink / Drink it if you can …”) is strangely hypnotic, particularly because each member sings a line in turn. It’s a showcase for their strong voices, and it turns out that Max George – the one who pops up in the tabloids from time to time – has an especially resonant one. Not coincidentally, this was the Wanted’s only hit in America.<br></p>","wordcount":"2027","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-24T00:00:00Z","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T13:18:52Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2017-05-31T16:21:56Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/448m6","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","bodyText":"1 The Monkees – (I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone Some contend that the Beatles were the first boyband, but the Monkees were the first group purpose-built to actually be one – or to play the part of one, anyway, in the eponymous 1960s sitcom.

There was a proto-punk snarl to some of their singles, they dabbled in disco on others and in 1977 they executed a complete change of direction. Harry Maslin, who’d just produced David Bowie’s Station to Station, was brought in to oversee their new album, It’s a Game, and he gave them a Philly-soul makeover that made them sound like a different band. This song is heavy with synths, strings and horns, yet light on its feet. Just two-and-a-half minutes long, it breezes in and breezes out again, piloted by Les McKeown’s airy lead vocal. During the middle eight, guitarist Eric Faulkner whips off a creditably funky break, and the rhythm section is spot on. Sadly, the Rollers were in decline by then, and the song lacked the anthemic chantalong quality of earlier smashes like Shang-a-Lang (which, by the way, influenced the embryonic Sex Pistols). Consequently, it was too slick for their remaining fans, too lightweight for their older siblings. Though it made the top 10 in North America, it was their lowest-charting single in Britain, its sophistication falling on deaf ears. 5 Wham! – Young Guns (Go for It) Though best remembered as the testbed for George Michael’s solo career, Wham! were extravagantly endowed with pop nous. Michael and pretty-boy bandmate Andrew Ridgeley had exactly the right payload of cuteness and feigned naughtiness, and 19-year-old songwriter Michael had an astonishing grasp of melody and dynamics.

Instead, it’s understated R&amp;B with a trace of folk, and accented by that least cool of instruments, the accordion. If singer/MC Simon Webbe hadn’t dropped a superfluous rap into the middle – most boybands of the era had a rapping member who injected grit as required – it could have been a lost 60s single. Distinctive and moreish, it’s a fantastic debut; 13 years later, it’s still a one-off – as different from the usual boyband run of things as accordions are from synthesisers (though both were used on the song). And although the girl-cheats-on-boy subject matter is familiar, there’s a cute twist: the song is set in a courtroom, where the girl is on “trial” for lying (and wearing bad hair extensions, no doubt). “Objection overruled … the jury will decide … I rest my case!” they sing ringingly. It was a song that was hard to top, and they never did. 10 The Wanted – Glad You Came A significant problem faced by modern British boybands is the genre’s narrow musical parameters. On the one hand, there’s the pop-rock of McBusted and the Vamps; on the other, the rinsed-out R&amp;B of Kingsland Road. Any group that diverges from those templates sounds wildly original, which is why Glad You Came, by British/Irish quintet the Wanted, is the only post-2010 song on this list. As with Blue’s All Rise, accordion plays a central part on the Wanted’s 2011 single, giving it a dash of cartoon-French melancholy, and the lyrics cleverly interlock, with each song-line starting with the last word of the previous line. It doesn’t sound impressive in print, but hearing it (“Turn the lights out now / Now I’ll take you by the hand / Hand you another drink / Drink it if you can …”) is strangely hypnotic, particularly because each member sings a line in turn. It’s a showcase for their strong voices, and it turns out that Max George – the one who pops up in the tabloids from time to time – has an especially resonant one. Not coincidentally, this was the Wanted’s only hit in America.","charCount":"11476"},"references":[{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/adult-contemporary","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/synth-pop","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/gothic-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/post-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/pop","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/classic-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/art-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/garage-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/grunge","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/rock-roll","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/rock-pop","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainz/1a1cd7f3-e5df-4eca-bae2-2757c9e656b5","type":"musicbrainz"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/pop-rap","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/rock-and-roll","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/pop-and-chart","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/soft-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/synthpop","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/southern-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainz/f27ec8db-af05-4f36-916e-3d57f91ecf5e","type":"musicbrainz"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/pop rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/progressive-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/other-pop","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/classic-pop-and-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/schlager","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email","type":"rich-link"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/rockabilly","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/top-40","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainz/ccb8f30e-4d71-40c4-8b1d-846dafe73e2c","type":"musicbrainz"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/ballad","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainz/24d2505b-388c-46cc-8a64-48223ea6d78d","type":"musicbrainz"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/goth-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"},{"id":"musicbrainz/9c79224c-70cd-4367-8d90-35ca99401b75","type":"musicbrainz"},{"id":"musicbrainzgenre/hard-rock","type":"musicbrainzgenre"}],"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2014/dec/17/police-charged-death-thomas-orchard-custody","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T13:14:07Z","webTitle":"Police sergeant and custody officers charged over death of Thomas Orchard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/17/police-charged-death-thomas-orchard-custody","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/17/police-charged-death-thomas-orchard-custody","fields":{"headline":"Police sergeant and custody officers charged over death of Thomas Orchard","standfirst":"Sergeant Jan Kingshott, Simon Tansley and Michael Marsden are accused of manslaughter and misconduct in public office","trailText":"Sergeant Jan Kingshott, Simon Tansley and Michael Marsden are accused of manslaughter and misconduct in public office","byline":"Sandra Laville","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07b46b5460a04268dc2933e39b071a1582d35fc4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418820593395/Police-officer-011.jpg\" alt=\"Police officer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orchard died seven days after collapsing in a police cell, where a padded belt had been placed over his mouth and nose.

The Crown Prosecution Service announced on Wednesday that the three officers – Sergeant Jan Kingshott, Simon Tansley and Michael Marsden – had been charged with manslaughter and misconduct in public office over the death of 32-year-old Thomas Orchard in October 2012. Kingshott is a police officer, while Tansley and Marsden are members of police staff. Orchard – who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia – died in hospital seven days after collapsing unconscious in a cell at Heavitree police station in Exeter. He had been bound in handcuffs and leg restraints and a padded belt had been placed across his mouth and nose. He had been in police custody for half an hour when he lost consciousness. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation into his death examined the risk around using a padded restraining belt around an individual’s head to stop them spitting or biting. Malcolm McHaffie, the CPS deputy head of special crime, announced the charges on Wednesday against the officers. “Sergeant Jan Kingshott and Custody Detention Officers Simon Tansley and Michael Marsden, all of Devon &amp; Cornwall Constabulary, have been charged with the manslaughter of Thomas Orchard and with misconduct in public office,” he said. “As part of our review of this case we have also decided that there is insufficient evidence to bring charges against three Devon &amp; Cornwall police constables and an on-site custody nurse employed by Serco. “The decision to prosecute was reached after careful consideration of the evidence and was taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors. We have determined that there is sufficient evidence to give rise to a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest. “All three individuals will appear at Exeter magistrates court on 29 January 2015.” Orchard worked as a church caretaker in Exeter. He was arrested in the centre of the city at 11.10am on 3 October 2012 after the police received 999 calls reporting his disturbed behaviour. He was brought to the ground – according to witnesses – put into a van and driven to the police station where he was restrained and shortly afterwards collapsed. Orchard was kept in a coma in hospital but did not recover. Details of the charges against the officers said they had allegedly committed manslaughter by unlawful act, alleging all three had used unlawful force on Orchard; and gross negligence manslaughter, alleging that the officers breached their duty of care to Orchard by restraining him in a way that restricted his breathing over a prolonged period of time. The officers are also charged with misconduct in public office in that they allegedly wilfully misconducted themselves in relation to their dealings with Orchard. The IPCC investigation into the death of Orchard examined the actions of four police officers, two custody staff and an agency nurse. The watchdog sent a file to the CPS in 2014 and to the Health and Safety Executive asking it consider a corporate prosecution against the force. After its investigation the IPCC said it had identified a risk in the way the emergency restraint belt was used on Orchard where it was tied around his face to stop him spitting or biting. The watchdog wrote to all forces in England and Wales in November 2012 expressing its concern about the risk to individuals from using the belt in this way. The family of Orchard released a statement through the charity Inquest, which has been supporting them. They said: “We welcome today’s decision; it makes us cautiously optimistic that justice will be done for our much-loved son and brother.

I’ll miss ‘Colbert.’ But I’m really excited about Colbert.","charCount":"3154"},"references":[],"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2014/dec/17/holidays-and-the-cost-of-mental-health-author-of-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-says-you-are-not-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T13:00:10Z","webTitle":"Author of The Perks of Being a Wallflower says: 'you are not alone'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/17/holidays-and-the-cost-of-mental-health-author-of-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-says-you-are-not-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/dec/17/holidays-and-the-cost-of-mental-health-author-of-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-says-you-are-not-alone","fields":{"headline":"The cost of mental health: How one author advises kids with depression","standfirst":"<p>Stephen Chbosky, the author of the 1999 novel, on mental health issues and why it’s important to talk about the issues as well as the recovery</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/-sp-front-lines-mental-health-america\">On the front lines of mental health: ‘If you’re mentally ill in America, you are shit outta luck’</a><br></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/29/ezra-miller-perks-of-wallflower\">Ezra Miller and the perks of being a new kind of pin-up</a><br></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/13/perks-of-being-wallflower-quidditch\">The Perks of Being a Wallflower – a whole new game of Quidditch</a><br></li></ul>","trailText":"Stephen Chbosky, the author of the 1999 novel, on mental health issues and why it’s important to talk about the issues as well as the recovery","byline":"Jana Kasperkevic","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-26eedb54-4128-480f-bee3-8542bcb9cd5c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416490651334/cfed841d-c506-474d-bd51-4f0045115333-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, film\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reece Thompson, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman and Mae Whitman in The Perks of Being a Wallflower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Summit/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear friend, </p> <p>I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand ...”</p> </blockquote> <p>Friend. That’s what Stephen Chbosky has become to many readers of his 1999 novel, The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Just as Charlie, the main character, writes to a friend whom he feels he can tell anything, so do readers write to Chbosky. </p> <p>“I think that so many readers want to reach out to Charlie and so I feel like I have become the next best thing,” says Chbosky. “I receive letters, phone calls, emails and tweets with young people facing every possible mental health or just emotional challenge that you can think of. You name the issue, I received a letter about it.”</p> <p>It was all of the correspondence that inspired Chbosky to turn his novel into a movie, making The Perks of Being a Wallflower into a “communal experience” instead of the solitary reading experience it was before. </p> <p>“It’s harder to feel alone if you see dozens of people around you laughing and crying or nodding their heads at the same issues,” he says. </p> <p>The novel as well as the movie are popular with the generation most commonly known to us as the millennials. This is also the generation that is said to no longer face the stigma of seeking mental health help and is represented by the likes of Lena Dunham, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/difficult-girl\">who has been quite open about her time in therapy</a>. </p> <p>After talking to a collection of millennials about their experience with therapy, The Guardian spoke to Chbosky about his take on some of the issues they brought up. Here is the interview, edited for clarity and space. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"US Money Perks of being the wall flower\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/QjplcD0dz_g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Charlie: ‘Do you think if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?’</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>It’s often said that people don’t talk about their problems because of the stigma associated with mental health.

But I do know that for many great people, they are very ashamed to be struggling. </p> <p>Let’s take for example, depression. Depression is invisible. It’s an invisible scar and so many people who suffer from it, they are told for most of their lives: <em>‘C’mon, snap out of it. What’s wrong?

Even though there might not be stigma, they have been told to get over it for so long that they feel there must be something wrong with them. There is nothing wrong with them. They just have an illness that they need to treat, just like anyone would treat allergies or a cold. It’s more complicated than that, obviously. </p> <p>People should do it when they feel ready to do it.

For a great many people who suffer from these silent illnesses, I feel they are doing themselves a great disservice by not admitting to their great friends what’s going on, because their true friends will stand by them and all of these people will realize what it’s like to be loved and supported for being exactly who you are, not who you are pretending to be. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-996ade84-adb4-4d97-9896-62ba81094aa7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/20/1416509001766/9a73183e-49b8-4ac1-af1a-72eeca181d58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“A true friend will accept and support you no matter what,” says Chbosky. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Bramley/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sometimes the cost of therapy, which adds up over time, deters people from treating these ‘silent illnesses’.

He wants to see it operating commercially in a decade, which he argues would cut the cost of meeting climate change targets and support 15,000 jobs a year. Making this a condition of future coal use provides the urgency to make it happen. There is little wrong with a policy which keeps the lights on while limiting the damage to the environment and creating jobs.

The Virgin franchise is already epitomized by “perky” – at least the airline elements of it are, as Virgin Trains, cleaving through Britain along the West Coast Main Line, is a more foreboding experience – and, of course, there is no more perky way to travel that cruise liners. “Cruise ship entertainment” – long the insult of choice for such purveyors of sophistication as Simon Cowell – is perfectly suited to Branson’s existing style, and “Virgin Cruises” the perfect marriage of that style with a mode of delivery. You can see the reality show, already, right?</p> <p>The clichéd idea of life onboard – all struggling entertainers and group-home type activities – is not, apparently, what Branson is aiming for. In the publicity material for the enterprise, which is still five years from launch, the emphasis is on a classy experience, with the Virgin fleet apparently drawing on <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/richard-bransons-virgin-empire-to-offer-cruises-on-the-high-seas/?_r=1\">“downtown Manhattan and SoHo”</a> for inspiration.</p> <p> His inspiration raises certain questions.

The Virgin franchise is already epitomized by “perky” – at least the airline elements of it are, as Virgin Trains, cleaving through Britain along the West Coast Main Line, is a more foreboding experience – and, of course, there is no more perky way to travel that cruise liners. “Cruise ship entertainment” – long the insult of choice for such purveyors of sophistication as Simon Cowell – is perfectly suited to Branson’s existing style, and “Virgin Cruises” the perfect marriage of that style with a mode of delivery. You can see the reality show, already, right? The clichéd idea of life onboard – all struggling entertainers and group-home type activities – is not, apparently, what Branson is aiming for. In the publicity material for the enterprise, which is still five years from launch, the emphasis is on a classy experience, with the Virgin fleet apparently drawing on “downtown Manhattan and SoHo” for inspiration. His inspiration raises certain questions. Which bit of downtown Manhattan? Broadway on a Saturday afternoon a week before Christmas? The Lower East Side on garbage day? Murray Hill during Santacon? At sea for two weeks with a bunch of vomiting hipsters and suddenly the back end of Virgin economy on a full flight from Bangkok starts to look like an ideal way to travel. What Branson means, obviously, is the SoHo of our Hollywood-based dreams, some 1990s version of a loft experience in which people mill about drinking cocktails and exchanging bon mots. It’s an empty and increasingly outdated marketing ploy, like those terrible bars in London named after New York neighbourhoods – or worse, the yuppie apartment complex currently going up in Tottenham, north London, in which the units are called things like Tribeca and Bushwick.

Magistrate Christine Chamberlain told the 13-year-old that he would remain in detention at a youth establishment until his case comes to trial at the Old Bailey on 6 January next year.","charCount":"724"},"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2014/dec/17/schumann-piano-sonata-op-14-maltempo-cd-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T12:44:00Z","webTitle":"Schumann: Piano Sonata Op 14 etc CD review – Maltempo proves his versatility and passion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/17/schumann-piano-sonata-op-14-maltempo-cd-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2014/dec/17/schumann-piano-sonata-op-14-maltempo-cd-review","fields":{"headline":"Schumann: Piano Sonata Op 14 etc CD review – Maltempo proves his versatility and passion","standfirst":"(Vincenzo Maltempo)<br />Piano Classics","trailText":"Vincenzo Maltempo proves he is much more than a one-trick pony with this disc of lesser-known Schumann pieces, writes <strong>Andrew Clements</strong>","byline":"Andrew Clements","main":"","body":"<p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/18/alkan-le-festin-desope-review\" title=\"\">three exceptional discs of Alkan</a> for Piano Classics, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Vincenzo Maltempo</a> has been given the chance to show that&#xa0;he is much more than one-trick virtuoso pony with this Schumann collection.

This piece is about the second government victory and the public dialogue on hearsay evidence between the human rights court in Strasbourg and the supreme court in London.</p> <p>Our story begins in May 2005 when Peter Rice, an alcoholic, was badly beaten at his flat in Birkenhead. He recovered in hospital and was able to make a statement to the police a month later. He died of an alcohol-related illness just over a year later.</p> <p>Michael Horncastle, 34, and David Blackmore, 33, were charged with causing Rice grievous bodily harm with intent. Since Rice had died before their trial, the police wanted to read his statement to the jury. The judge agreed. There was also supporting evidence. Horncastle and Blackmore were convicted in 2007 and imprisoned.</p> <p>While they were on trial for an unrelated incident, six burglars broke into a house in Nottingham. It was 7pm. Gary Price, who lived there, was out but his partner, Hannah Miles, was at home. After threatening her with a knife, the burglars kidnapped Miles. She was later released unharmed.</p> <p>Miles and Price made short statements to the police which they later tried to retract. Miles said she had been very frightened of what the kidnappers might do to her. Price feared reprisals. Neither Miles not Price attended court when ordered to do so, though they risked imprisonment for contempt. So the judge allowed Miles’s statement to be read to the jury. Again, there was other evidence.</p> <p>In May 2008, Abijah Marquis, 36, and Joseph Graham, 33, were convicted of kidnapping Miles and imprisoned.</p> <p>In 2009, all four men appealed against their convictions on the grounds that their alleged victim’s written statement should not have been admitted. English law normally requires evidence in person from a witness who speaks from his or her own observation or knowledge. Secondhand evidence – given by a person to whom the absent witness has spoken or in a document created by the missing witness – is known as hearsay. That can be admitted only if it comes within <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/part/11/chapter/2\" title=\"\">exceptions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003</a>. The legislation includes important safeguards designed to ensure a fair trial.</p> <p>The men’s appeal was based on article 6 of the human rights convention, the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to examine prosecution witnesses. They relied on a ruling that the human rights court had delivered a couple of months earlier. In <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-90781#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-90781%22]}\" title=\"ECHR\">Al-Khawaja and Tahery v UK</a>, a chamber of the court had <a href=\" http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=\" 001-90781\"\" title=\"\">ruled</a> that article 6 would be breached if a conviction had been based solely or decisively on statements that a defendant had received no opportunity of challenging.</p> <p>That looked like a problem for the court of appeal. Under the Human Rights Act 1998, courts are required to take rulings by the Strasbourg court into account. But a five-judge appeal court led by the present lord chief justice was able to find that there had been no breach of article 6. Putting it politely, the judges were saying that European court had misunderstood English hearsay law. Since the Strasbourg judges had got Al-Khawaja wrong, the English court dismissed the four men’s appeals.</p> <p>That was in May 2009. A couple of months later, the men appealed to the UK’s highest court. And in December 2009, the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2009_0073_Judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">supreme court agreed</a> with the court of appeal.</p> <p>Speaking for a unanimous court, Lord Phillips, the president, recalled that exceptions to the hearsay rule had been approved by parliament. “The requirement to ‘take into account’ the Strasbourg jurisprudence will normally result in this court applying principles that are clearly established by the Strasbourg court,” Phillips acknowledged.</p> <p>“There will, however, be rare occasions where this court has concerns as to whether a decision of the Strasbourg court sufficiently appreciates or accommodates particular aspects of our domestic process. In such circumstances it is open to this court to decline to follow the Strasbourg decision, giving reasons for adopting this course.</p> <p>“This is likely to give the Strasbourg court the opportunity to reconsider the particular aspect of the decision that is in issue, so that there takes place what may prove to be a valuable dialogue between this court and the Strasbourg court. This is such a case.”</p> <p>That dialogue involved two stages. First, the government lodged what amounted to an appeal against the Al-Khawaja judgment. In December 2011, the court’s grand chamber <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/dec/15/strasbourg-heeds-uk-judges\" title=\"\">modified its earlier ruling</a>.</p> <p>The Strasbourg judges agreed with their British counterparts that a conviction based solely or decisively on the statement of an absent witness would not automatically result in a breach of article 6. However, there would still a breach of the defendant’s rights unless there were counterbalancing factors, including strong procedural safeguards, to compensate for the difficulties caused to the defence and the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence.</p> <p>But that left open the question of whether there was a breach of article 6 in the Horncastle and Marquis cases, as there had been in one of the two cases covered by the Al-Khawaja ruling (that of Tahery). We now have the <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-148673\" title=\"\">Strasbourg chamber decision</a> applying Al-Khawaja to the facts of these cases.</p> <p>In the Horncastle case, the court concluded it was “more than arguable”, in the light of other incriminating evidence, that Rice’s statement was not decisive in the sense that it determined the outcome of the case. And even if it was “there were sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for any difficulties caused to the defence by the admission of the statement”. So there was no breach of article 6.</p> <p>In the Marquis case, the Strasbourg judges were satisfied there was good reason for Miles’s failure to attend court and give evidence. The trial judge had found she was “petrified, genuinely in distress”. Moreover, “in light of the other strong incriminating evidence in the case, it cannot be said that [her] statement was of such significance or importance as to be likely to determine the outcome of the case against the applicants. Her statement was therefore neither the sole nor the decisive basis of the applicants’ convictions.”</p> <p>So there was no need to consider whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors. Once again, the judges were unanimous: there was no breach of the human rights convention.</p> <p>These rulings, though not surprising, are clearly just. But the Horncastle dialogue has a deeper lesson for justice secretary and other Conservatives who argue that the Strasbourg court’s rulings should be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/oct/03/tory-plans-european-human-rights-convention-take-uk-back-50-years\" title=\"\">advisory rather than binding</a>.</p> <p>Sure, there is no “democratic override” – no parliament can overturn the decisions of the court’s grand chamber – but the European court, like any other institution, is capable of getting things wrong.

They subsequently changed their mind on that too – so that 15 English cities now have elected mayors, though citizens given local referendums on the subject said no (except in Bristol).</p> <p>Straw also remarked that the West Lothian issue is “a bigger problem in theory than in practice”. That’s true too. Tory and Labour governments were both happy to use Northern Irish Unionist votes from 1921 to the devolved <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Buildings_(Northern_Ireland)\" title=\"\">Stormont parliament</a>’s temporary abolition in 1972. Only briefly have Westminster governments ever depended on Scottish votes or so-called “English-only legislation” either.</p> <p>What’s changed is that the SNP-led clamour for independence on the back of the party’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2011\" title=\"\">fluke majority win at Holyrood</a> in 2011 means it is in Edinburgh’s perceived self-interest to foment discontent against Westminster.

He politely offered the Lib Dem plan for English regional federalism where it is wanted (it wasn’t wanted when John Prescott staged a pilot referendum in the north-east), plus three Tory mechanisms for giving English MPs a block on English-only (mostly?) laws at Westminster.</p> <p>The Guardian’s excellent two-part series – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/15/-sp-britain-on-brink-real-story-scottish-independence\" title=\"\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/16/-sp-real-story-scottish-referendum-final-days-fight-for-independence\" title=\"\">here</a> – revealed that the no campaign leader, Alistair Darling, warned Cameron not to link the Smith commission plan for enhanced powers to Scotland – published last month – with the Evel (English votes for English laws) dimension in his post-result speech.</p> <p>Cameron preferred to stick to his pre-drafted text. It gave the Nats fresh momentum and a whole new “betrayal” script, which helps them distract voters’ attention from the collapsing world price of Scotland’s famous oil.</p> <p>Hague actually claimed that the coalition had engaged in “the most radical programme of decentralisation in England for decades”. That’s cheeky. The Tories abolished regional development agencies (RDAs), whose record was patchy, but were superior instruments to their replacement, local enterprise partnerships (LEPs).

Southern backwoodsmen tried to break up the United States over slavery in 1861. A few years later Napoleon III was tricked into attacking Prussia by Bismark. Britain fatally failed to make its intentions clear to Germany in 1914 and put sterling back on the deflationary gold standard in 1925. George Bush went into Iraq on half-baked planning. And so on. By this test, is David Cameron sleepwalking into a breakup of the United Kingdom, something not even Vladimir Putin wants to see – though fellow-nationalists, Alex Salmond and Nigel Farage are big fans – as he seeks to handle the Scottish (not to mention the EU) dimensions of policy for tactical party advantage? It sounded so yesterday when William Hague set out the coalition’s own half-baked ideas for addressing the famous West Lothian question – why should West Lothian’s Scottish MP vote at Westminster on matters pertaining to West Bromwich? As wise Jack Straw observed in the subsequent exchanges, neither Hague nor his party are best placed to pronounce on this subject, since they opposed Scots and Welsh devolution as well as a devolved, elected mayor for London. They subsequently changed their mind on that too – so that 15 English cities now have elected mayors, though citizens given local referendums on the subject said no (except in Bristol). Straw also remarked that the West Lothian issue is “a bigger problem in theory than in practice”. That’s true too. Tory and Labour governments were both happy to use Northern Irish Unionist votes from 1921 to the devolved Stormont parliament’s temporary abolition in 1972. Only briefly have Westminster governments ever depended on Scottish votes or so-called “English-only legislation” either. What’s changed is that the SNP-led clamour for independence on the back of the party’s fluke majority win at Holyrood in 2011 means it is in Edinburgh’s perceived self-interest to foment discontent against Westminster. That inevitably stirs up latent nationalist sentiment of the UK’s English majority – along with the fear that they must be losing out to ungrateful Scots who seem to get treated better for their complaints. Hague’s four proposals yesterday – you can read the Hansard here – were received without much enthusiasm. He politely offered the Lib Dem plan for English regional federalism where it is wanted (it wasn’t wanted when John Prescott staged a pilot referendum in the north-east), plus three Tory mechanisms for giving English MPs a block on English-only (mostly?) laws at Westminster. The Guardian’s excellent two-part series – here and here – revealed that the no campaign leader, Alistair Darling, warned Cameron not to link the Smith commission plan for enhanced powers to Scotland – published last month – with the Evel (English votes for English laws) dimension in his post-result speech. Cameron preferred to stick to his pre-drafted text. It gave the Nats fresh momentum and a whole new “betrayal” script, which helps them distract voters’ attention from the collapsing world price of Scotland’s famous oil. Hague actually claimed that the coalition had engaged in “the most radical programme of decentralisation in England for decades”. That’s cheeky. The Tories abolished regional development agencies (RDAs), whose record was patchy, but were superior instruments to their replacement, local enterprise partnerships (LEPs). Police commissioners were imposed, not very successfully. Welcome though they are, the “northern powerhouse” plans take ministers back to near where Labour was a decade ago. Success story Manchester is having a mayor imposed. Eric “localism” Pickles is a byword for central authority, his chief localist achievement being to decentralise the pain of council cuts. Ditto the NHS reforms. There is renewed talk of consolidating the 43 English and Welsh police forces into 20, a step the devolved centralisers at Holyrood have already taken. It’s improvised and patchy, not much theory there, very British. But it’s too important to be rushed. So I suspect that – this time anyway – Labour is right to say there should be a constitutional convention to try and impose some coherence on what we are trying to do and why. England is so huge in comparison with its island neighbours – 54 million of the 64 million people in the UK – that the very idea of the majority being “threatened” by Celtic minorities is the stuff of 3am nightmares that vanish with daylight. That’s not to say people don’t have legitimate worries, but this shouldn’t be about whether Labour loses its Scottish contingent in forming a UK government or short-term Tory advantage. It’s more important than that, much more important, and should be treated as such. As with Europe, where he has also been surprisingly cavalier (not consulting lawyers or diplomats on his recent immigration speech), Cameron must try harder if he wants to be remembered as constructive statesmen in tough times. As things stand Cameron and his inner circle run the risk of being remembered, if at all, as third-rate chancers, Napoleon IIIs not Abraham Lincolns, who failed to measure up to events, broke up and diminished the state.","charCount":"5203"},"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2014/dec/17/reddit-bans-users-for-sharing-hacked-sony-documents","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T12:31:31Z","webTitle":"Reddit bans users for sharing hacked Sony documents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/17/reddit-bans-users-for-sharing-hacked-sony-documents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/dec/17/reddit-bans-users-for-sharing-hacked-sony-documents","fields":{"headline":"Reddit bans users for sharing hacked Sony documents","standfirst":"<p>The social news site has acceded to a DMCA takedown request from Sony and removed a hub for sharing the company’s hacked files</p>","trailText":"The social news site has acceded to a DMCA takedown request from Sony and removed a hub for sharing the company’s hacked files","byline":"Alex Hern","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60ea7669175d70d4327835c5ad946630207c9fa1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418818191346/2e200757-cda7-458b-b119-8ef86a8bd56e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The entrance of Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California is seen December 16, 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The entrance of Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California is seen December 16, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>In the wake of the massive hack that has seen more than 250GB of private files shared online, Sony Pictures is successfully cracking down on discussion of its stolen data on sites such as Reddit.</p> <p>The social news site has deleted posts, blocked individual user accounts, and banned a subreddit devoted to sharing the files, after takedown notices from the film company.</p> <p>At the core of the deletions, prompted by a takedown notice from Sony citing the American Digital Millennium Copyright Act, was the SonyGOP subreddit.

Photograph: Paul Turner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Both my first novel, Sons and Other Flammable Objects, and my latest one, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/last-illusion.html\">The Last Illusion</a>, are 9/11 novels. I have never minded that classification, as the attacks were a central event in both of them, just as they were in my life. Another reason is that I feel they are in good company. Critics have been quick to dismiss the 9/11 literature that has emerged, but there are several truly great books that have tackled this fairly impossible subject, and dozens more pretty good ones. These are my recommendations, published between 2003 and 2011.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/23/reluctant-fundamentalist-mohsin-hamid-review\">The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid</a></h2> <p>Hamid is one of my favourite writers and this book is pretty mind-blowing. For one thing, its narrative structure is fascinating: the whole thing is a dramatic monologue. We’re in a cafe in Lahore and a Pakistani is telling his life story to an American. The Pakistani happens to be a former American – a successful Princeton graduate, who at one time had a great job and an American girlfriend. After 9/11, he retreats from it all, but the real question is: how much of a choice did he have?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\">The Emperor’s Children by Claire Messud</a></h2> <p>Messud has been a great supporter of my work, so it may look biased to choose this; but many agree The Emperor’s Children is the best 9/11 novel. Messud captures the struggles of a still-very-much-alive Manhattan privileged intellectual class through the portrait of three friends, just as well as she evokes those months leading up to the attacks.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview17\">A Disorder Peculiar to the Country by Ken Kalfus</a></h2> <p>This is one of my favourite 9/11 works. To attempt a dark comedy about 9/11 is already something, but to make it this funny and crazy is something else – and something only a writer as good as Kalfus can do. He dares to ask: what if you actually were, for a moment, relieved to hear your spouse was in the towers? What if their survival was a disappointment? This portrait of a completely broken couple at a time when the world is also completely broken is unforgettable.</p> <h2>The Zero by Jess Walter</h2> <p>Another very original dark comedy about 9/11, Walter’s Kafka-esque political thriller has an outrageous premise: he takes an NYPD cop who has shot himself in the head and suffers from terrible memory gaps and assigns him the task of giving Ground Zero tours to celebrities …<br></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/26/fiction.dondelillo\">Falling Man by Don DeLillo</a></h2> <p>DeLillo is one of my favorite authors, period, so it’s hard for me not to love everything he writes.

I have never minded that classification, as the attacks were a central event in both of them, just as they were in my life. Another reason is that I feel they are in good company. Critics have been quick to dismiss the 9/11 literature that has emerged, but there are several truly great books that have tackled this fairly impossible subject, and dozens more pretty good ones. These are my recommendations, published between 2003 and 2011. The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid Hamid is one of my favourite writers and this book is pretty mind-blowing. For one thing, its narrative structure is fascinating: the whole thing is a dramatic monologue. We’re in a cafe in Lahore and a Pakistani is telling his life story to an American. The Pakistani happens to be a former American – a successful Princeton graduate, who at one time had a great job and an American girlfriend. After 9/11, he retreats from it all, but the real question is: how much of a choice did he have? The Emperor’s Children by Claire Messud Messud has been a great supporter of my work, so it may look biased to choose this; but many agree The Emperor’s Children is the best 9/11 novel. Messud captures the struggles of a still-very-much-alive Manhattan privileged intellectual class through the portrait of three friends, just as well as she evokes those months leading up to the attacks. A Disorder Peculiar to the Country by Ken Kalfus This is one of my favourite 9/11 works. To attempt a dark comedy about 9/11 is already something, but to make it this funny and crazy is something else – and something only a writer as good as Kalfus can do. He dares to ask: what if you actually were, for a moment, relieved to hear your spouse was in the towers? What if their survival was a disappointment? This portrait of a completely broken couple at a time when the world is also completely broken is unforgettable. The Zero by Jess Walter Another very original dark comedy about 9/11, Walter’s Kafka-esque political thriller has an outrageous premise: he takes an NYPD cop who has shot himself in the head and suffers from terrible memory gaps and assigns him the task of giving Ground Zero tours to celebrities … Falling Man by Don DeLillo DeLillo is one of my favorite authors, period, so it’s hard for me not to love everything he writes. This not my favourite DeLillo, but I still liked it. I love the simple premise of a lawyer who worked in the World Trade Centre surviving the attack and yet not quite surviving his life in the aftermath, intertwined with the narrative of a “falling man” performance artist. Home Boy by HM Naqvi This British-Pakistani novelist was big on the US slam poetry circuit for a while – and this is evident in his slang-studded, electric prose. This debut novel is a mix of the classic and the original: half immigrant fiction, half coming-of-age NYC novel. The three young guys of Pakistani origin on whom the book focuses give Naqvi a way to explore the post-9/11 Muslim experience, but they also offer insights as to what it means to be American – now or at any time. The Submission by Amy Waldman I met Amy Waldman at a writing residency just a year after this came out and we became friends. We share a journalism background but Amy was a hard-hitting news reporter at the New York Times, and this is very much the work of someone with that experience.

There were hugs and tears in a south Texas courtroom on Tuesday when a judge set bail of $50,000 (£32,000) for Hannah Overton, who has maintained her innocence since she was found culpable in the death of a four-year-old boy. Her 2007 trial attracted nationwide attention and prompted claims that she was wrongfully convicted. Members of Overton’s church were organising payment of the bail amount, according to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, which first reported the hearing’s outcome. The prosecution had reportedly sought a $250,000 bond. The judge, Mario Ramirez Jr, did not set a restriction limiting Overton’s contact with her children after hearing several hours of testimony from witnesses who praised her character. In prison she was allowed to see her family once a month but not make physical contact. Ramirez ordered those involved in the case not to speak to the media. Overton’s conviction for capital murder was overturned in September by the Texas court of criminal appeals, which found that the defence’s failure to present testimony from a sodium poisoning expert seriously undermined the original trial’s outcome. Her family’s joy at the news was tempered when in response, rather than seek a lesser charge or dismiss the case, the Nueces County district attorney, Mark Skurka, opted to prosecute again on the same charge. A trial is expected to take place next year. “No jury, no trial judge and no appellate court has ever found that defendant Hannah Overton is not responsible for the death of Andrew Burd,” Skurka said in October. Andrew had been living in Corpus Christi with Hannah and Larry Overton pending formal completion of his adoption by the pair, a devout Christian couple with no prior criminal history. The boy, who had behavioural problems, suddenly developed breathing difficulties, fell into a coma and died in hospital in October 2006. Prosecutors alleged the Overtons were culpable for his death, arguing at a televised trial that Hannah was an ill-tempered parent who disciplined the child for bad behaviour by fatally force-feeding him with spicy seasoning. Larry Overton pleaded no contest to criminally negligent homicide so that he could avoid prison and take care of their five children. Hannah, who at the time of the boy’s death was aged 29 and was six months pregnant, was convicted of capital murder and given life without parole. A jury found her guilty of murder “by omission” on the basis that she had supposedly failed to seek adequate medical help for the child, even though the couple took him to an urgent care clinic. Her original defence team did not use testimony from Dr Michael Moritz, a salt intoxication expert who concluded that Overton did not poison Andrew, a compulsive eater who may have had an undiagnosed eating disorder. Moritz also said that early salt poisoning symptoms are often mild and would not necessarily give anyone reason to suspect a victim is seriously ill.","charCount":"3120"},"references":[],"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2014/dec/17/george-osborne-five-reasons-cheerful","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-17T12:24:44Z","webTitle":"George Osborne’s five reasons to be cheerful","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/dec/17/george-osborne-five-reasons-cheerful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2014/dec/17/george-osborne-five-reasons-cheerful","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne’s five reasons to be cheerful","standfirst":"The growth in UK wages is a welcome arrival for a chancellor desperates to create a feelgood factor for the general election","trailText":"The growth in UK wages is a welcome arrival for a chancellor desperates to create a feelgood factor for the general election","byline":"Larry Elliott","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ce97d6b6648066325d08c1b4c74761f010c12d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418818935490/f8899026-fa67-46c5-bd74-662e3756f1eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chancellor George Osborne has reasons to be cheerful.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chancellor George Osborne has reasons to be cheerful.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>George Osborne is calling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/17/pay-rise-british-workers-six-years-falling-wages\" title=\"\">Wednesday’s wage growth figures</a> a “major moment” in the UK’s economic recovery and it’s not hard to see why.

This is more or less accurate. Brittain was bored out of her mind during her girlhood in the beautiful but snobbish and conservative environs of Buxton. “Even at 18, a mentally voracious young woman cannot live entirely upon scenery,” she wrote, adding that she would have been in danger of “dying of spontaneous combustion” had she not had her diary to write and an interesting curate in a nearby village.

The meeting seems contrived, and it is – the two really met at dinner, according to Brittain’s memoir, and there was no book-throwing rage or patronising putdown. Both Vera and Roland are due to go to Oxford, until Roland announces – when they meet on the station platform to go up together – that he’s joining the army instead. The film has, understandably, dramatised this moment, which in real life was communicated by letter. “I don’t think in the circumstances I could easily bring myself to endure a secluded life of scholastic vegetation,” the real Roland Leighton wrote. “I feel that I am meant to take an active part in this war.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83b2bee9e19809a398fbfa6ee7dd378673c79d9a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418815785191/32139d9d-e9d8-43cb-b8b7-c67b98ca6c2b-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Alicia Vikander with Kit Harington in Testament of Youth\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘All these romantics aren’t good for you, you know’ … Kit Harington as Roland Leighton with Alicia Vikander as Vera Brittain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>More romance</h2> <p>The film’s recreation of Roland and Vera’s courtship is sweetly done, and the scene in which he leaves for the war – with a train full of desperate, heartbroken women saying goodbye to the men they love – is extremely moving.
